Expeditions are typically two months in length. While\nthe scientists typically have cruise-related research objectives,\ntheir duties during the cruise are taken up by routine measurements,\ndescribing the core materials. This includes geomagentic,\nsedimentological, chemical, biological, mineralogical, and structural\ndata.\n\nI participated twice and was part of the team documenting the\ninorganic chemistry of the water that is trapped between sediment\ngrains - the so-called interstitial water (IW)\n\nThe chemistry of the interstitial water is monitored for many ionic\nspecies, among them Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). Ammonium is measured on a\nphotospectrometer, which measures how much light passes through a\nsample container at a specified wavelength. This allows for very\nprecise concentration measurements but requires manual calibration. In\nthe first step, you have to mix standards, and in a second step, you\nmeasure those standards to create a calibration function. The\ncalibration function allows you to relate the light absorbance to the\nNH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration. In other words, we build a linear model to predict\nthe NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations based on the absorbance values we get\nfrom the photospectrometer.  The whole process is a bit of art, but\nafter practicing it for three days, I got this:\n\n![img](ammonium_311.png)\n\nBelow, you will find calibration data for my very first expedition in 1998. I\nwas total noob, I did not practice, and likely I was not careful\nenough mixing standards. Alas, my lab journal has not enough detail to\nunderstand why it was so bad.\n\n| NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>+ [mu mol/l]|Absorbance|\n|---|---|\n| 72|75|\n| 144|150|\n| 336|512|\n| 596|1000|\n\nCreate a regression analysis where you treat the absorbance data as\nthe independent variable, and the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration as the dependent\nvariable. \n\nPlot your data, similar to the above plot, and describe the error you\nwould get at an absorbance reading of 800 (i.e. +- XXX umol).\n\nNotes:\n\n-   Everything in this assignment, you have done before\n-   The first challenge is to combine the techniques you have learned in\n    such a way that you come to a successful solution.\n-   The second challenge is that I do not provide a structure. You will\n    have to make your own plan (revisit the coding as creative process\n    chapter before you begin)\n-   This assignment will will take more time than you think, as you\n    will encounter unforseen problems, have to go back to your notes or\n    research on the internet.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["There are no partial points.

If not, please speak up on the discussion board\n    and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel\n    uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the\n    same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it `ipyn` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. The best way to export your notebook as\npdf, is to select `print`, and then `print to pdf`.  Please submit\nboth files on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file\ncontains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf\nexport is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export\nproblems, please contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code as well as the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
