The loop should iterate over each sample in the list, calculate it's weight, and add it to the running weight. Once the running weight exceeds the load limit.

Rather, use a loop within a loop that first build the values in each row, and then adds each row. Remember that you can join strings. I also recommend to use two string variables, one that contains the string for the current row, and one that contains the string with the entire table (so you build the table row by row). While developing the program, use `print` instead of `display_markwdown`. Also, notice that it is easy to add the markup styling, so this should be your last step.

So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
