This is because the  `enumerate()` function returns a so-called generator object, rather than a list, but this is for another day. For this exercise, we want to write our own enumerate function (let's call it `my_enum()` that will simply return a list of tuples where each tuple has the following structure: `(index, value)` \n\nAs usual, it is much faster to develop new code incrementally, so let's approach this in the following way\n\n1.  Write a function that takes a list as an argument, and returns the list to the calling code. 1pt\n2.  Modify your function in such a way that it uses a loop to copy each list element into a new list, and return that list to the calling function. 1pt\n3.  Modify your function again, so that instead of copying each list element,  it will create a tuple for each list element, where the first element of the tuple equals the list index, and the second element equals the value at the given index. Note, create an empty tuple named `my_result` before you enter into the loop, and then append each tuple to `my_result`. Return `my_result` the calling function. Note, that you are not allowed to use the `enumerate()` function! 1pt\n4.  Add a doc-string that describes what your function does. 1pt\n5.  Test your code by running the following cell. The output of the print statements should be identical. 2pt\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"84d29d21-98df-4a47-963c-0e97bdcd9684","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["ml =

So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error.
