Set a = to 12 and then write a python statement in such a way that you get\n    the following output (1 point).\n    \n        The value of the variable a = 12\n    \n    Note I don't want you to type a string with these words. Use an f-string and use the appropriate syntax so that the actual value of `a` is printed.\n\n2.  Using the same code as above and include escape sequences in such a way that your printout is preceded and followed by an empty line (1 point).\n\n3.  Using the same code as in 2, precede and follow the empty lines with 41 dashes (see below). Note that rather than typing (and counting), use this statement `'-' * 41`. Your result should look like this - including the empty lines. (1 point).\n    \n        -----------------------------------------\n        \n        The value of the variable a = 12\n        \n        -----------------------------------------\n\n4.  [@4 ]Modify the first and last print statement from the previous questions in such a way that you get the output below (1 point)\n    \n        *----------------------------------------*\n        \n        The value of the variable a = 12\n        \n        *----------------------------------------*\n\n5.  Using the above code, add an escape sequence in front of \"The value&#x2026;\" to display the text shifted by one tab to the right. (1 point)\n\n6.  You are working on software for a point of sale system (i.e., cash register). Your software knows the sales price and how much cash you receive from the customer. Write some python code that calculates and displays the change owed. Your display should look like this (your number may be different!):\n    \n        Change owed = $12.40\n    \n    Notes: A) You code should correctly round the owed amount to the nearest 10 cents and display the cents as in the above example. This may require that you round the number first (using the `round()` function) before you display the number; B) You should achieve this by using the appropriate format modifier and by making good use of the f-string. Assume that the customer provided you with a twenty-dollar bill and that the item's price was CAD 6.63. Also, test your code with a price of $6.67. (4 points)\n\n7.  Using the example in #6, print a proper receipt rather than printing the change owed. Towards this end, add a variable that describes the item. Your output should look like this (note that the point separating the cents from the dollars must be aligned)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"8a9afb6b-f0d0-4ec4-a52f-841b9162229e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\nCheese         $6.63\nHST           $10.10\n-------------------\nTotal         $\n\nPaid          $\nChange owed = $\n\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3dd9473c-9bad-43bd-9b0f-0dee454ea763","metadata":{},"source":["Notes: This is meant to be an actual program.

The advantage is that if you want to change your price or item name, you change the variable definition at the beginning of the code, rather than having to modify the internals of your code.\n\nNotes: \n\n-   you first need to calculate the HST (13%)\n-   Do not forget to do the rounding and make sure that  `total` plus `changed_owed` are equal to `paid`. In other words, be  on the lookout for rounding errors.\n\n-   The dollar values should be three tab stops to the right (so that you have enough room for a meaningful product name). The length of the item description should be limited so that it won't displace the price. Test this by setting `item = \"Really Long Pasta\"` (5 points)\n\n-   Avoid long and complex print statements. Rather, use a new print statement for each line. Coding is the art of avoiding complexity.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1f6d30c7-8a37-46eb-af8a-29a5fe49cfd3","metadata":{},"source":["### Advanced Question 2 points\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"94d5f0af-9790-4481-8768-b428c280ac13","metadata":{},"source":["Write a single line print statement, that prints `Hello \\\\\\'\"World\"'`\n\nTotal Points: 16\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"267a399b-db5c-4d60-877c-7127b0cbb0a7","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4bbfab64-0679-4abd-8927-ec9355a0c860","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it.
