Here is a summary. If any of these concepts or terms are unclear, please go back to the previous modules and discuss them with your TA/Prof where necessary.\n\n1.  While python understands numbers without help, we have to mark strings with\n    quotation marks (otherwise, python would interpret it a variable or\n    function name): `s = \"Hello World\"`\n2.  It matters how we use brackets:\n    -   Square brackets to the right of an equal sign indicate that you declare a\n        list: `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Square brackets to the right of a name or letter\n        indicate an index expression: `a[1] = 22`. Index expressions can also be\n        used to address ranges and step-size: `a[1:2:1]`.\n    -   Round brackets to the right of an equal sign are used to declare a tuple:\n        `t=(1, 2, 3)`, whereas round brackets to the right of a name indicate that\n        this name is a function: `print()`. To access the 2<sup>nd</sup> element of the tuple,\n        you will still have to use square brackets since you are doing an index\n        operation: `t[1]`. Tuples are immutable.\n    -   Curly braces to the right are used to declare a set: `u = {1,2,3}`. Set\n        members cannot be retrieved by an index operation, and set values are\n        immutable.\n    -   Curly braces are also used to declare dictionaries. In this case, the\n        declaration contains key:value pairs that are separated by a colon. `d =\n               {\"B\":12, \"A\":14, \"C\":7}`. Dictionary entries can be retrieved by using an\n        index expression using the dictionary key: `d[\"B\"]`\n3.  A name followed by regular brackets denotes a python function: `print()`.\n    Functions exist independently of data (or objects like lists).\n4.  A name followed by a dot and another name with brackets denotes an object\n    method: `a.sort()` which only exists as long as the object `a` exists.\n    -   Object methods can either modify the object-associated data in place, e.g., `a.sort()`\n    -   Or, they do not modify the object associated data, but instead return\n        something, e.g., `s.split(\",\")`. So if you would like to change the\n        original data set, you would have to write an explicit assignment: `s =\n               s.split(\",\")`. If in doubt, use the `help()` function.\n5.  We can query the object type with the type function: `type(a)`, and we can\n    list the object-associated methods with the dir function: `dir(a)`\n6.  We can get help on python functions with the help command: `help(print)`\n7.  We can get help on object methods with the help function:\n    `help(list.pop)`\n8.  The name of a compound variable (e.g., lists) refers to its object handle,\n    not its value. Thus, the expression `my_new_list = my_old_list` will not copy\n    the list values; it will only copy the memory address where those values\n    are stored. In other words, if you modify `my_new_list`, you will also modify\n    `my_old_list`. To create an independent copy you need to use the copy method:\n    `my_new_list = my_old_list.copy()`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"00ef6379-39f4-4ffb-9513-213eecfbb9e4","metadata":{},"source":["### Using print()\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce7120d1-d50b-4f5a-af14-4115b9157b7a","metadata":{},"source":["By now, you probably noticed that the print statement is a function.

We use the So far, we have used the print function to echo the value of a variable back onto the screen. However, we can do much more with print function. This module will teach the basics of producing formatted output.  \n\nMost things python are straightforward, but the syntax of the print function is not. This is simply because every new python version provides new ways to format the print output. In this course, we will use the syntax provided since python 3.7, the so-called \"f-strings\". You will note that this is different from the syntax in many examples on the web, which often refer to python 2.7.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"99519d59-ec61-492d-a182-1a9769876c17","metadata":{},"source":["### F-strings\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"196eeb59-5bf5-48cb-9f67-c5877edf6e28","metadata":{},"source":[" The `print()` statement allows us to display the value of a variable.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"dfa29425-66a5-426a-9ca0-cc964cea5b62","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 2\nb = 4\nc = a * b\nprint(c)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9616d3ea-4a4d-4f15-b069-bbb30ea5c8a6","metadata":{},"source":["this is handy enough while you develop your code, but it would be nice if could print something more meaningful, e.g., \"The square-root of 12 equals 4\".\n\nIn other words, we need a way to mix strings with variable values.
