Transistors are nifty devices that allow us to control the flow of a large current with a small current. At their heart, they consist of two layers of thin silicon with additional electrons in the crystal lattice and a thin layer of silicon missing some electrons (or vice versa). This thin layer acts as an insulator and prevents any current flow (see the sketch below). However, if we add a small current to this layer, we will move some electrons into the thin layer, which will take the space of the missing electrons in the crystal lattice, and now the current can flow between the two outer layers until we remove the control current again - hence the term semiconductor. See this [youtube link](https://youtu.be/7ukDKVHnac4) for a detailed explanation.\n![img](transitor.png)\n\nFor our purposes, a transistor can be thought of as a simple switch that either lets an electrical current pass or not. As such, the transistor can reflect the numbers 0 (nothing passes) or 1 (everything passes). So with a single transistor, we can count two numbers (0, 1). Now, if we add another transistor, we should be able to count to four. However, since each transistor is either on or off, we need to express numbers in a binary system (i.e., a number system, which only knows two numbers, zero and one).\n\nLet's consider how we count. We have 10 fingers that we can use to count from 0 to 9. However, what happens if we need to count past 9?\n\n\n| 100-999|10-99|0-9|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|8|eight|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|9|nine|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|ten|\n| &nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|9|9|ninty nine|\n| 1|0|0|one hundred|\n\nSo each time we run out of fingers (counting apples, e.g.), we add a number to the left, which tells us that we already have ten (or twenty, thirty) apples, which we have to add to the current number of fingers. So we are counting in batches of 10. A more scientific way to say this is counting to the base of 10. We can rewrite the above table as\n\n\n| Row #|10<sup>2</sup>|10<sup>1</sup>|10<sup>0</sup>|Name/Value|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1|||0 * 10<sup>0</sup>|0|\n| 2|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| 3|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| 4|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|8 * 10<sup>0</sup>|eight|\n| 5|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|9 * 10<sup>0</sup>|nine|\n| 6|&nbsp;|1 * 10<sup>1</sup>|0 * 10<sup>0</sup>|ten|\n| 7|&nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| 8|&nbsp;|9 * 10<sup>1</sup>|9 * 10<sup>0</sup>|ninty nine|\n| 9|1 * 10<sup>2</sup>|0 * 10<sup>1</sup>|0 * 10<sup>0</sup>|one hundred|\n\nwhere you would have to multiply the table header with the column\nvalue, e.g., \n\n    10^0 x 8 = 1 x 8 = 8\n\nlet's try this with row 8\n\n    9 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^0 = 90 + 9 = 99\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a957df30-2c78-4d00-a891-ea21d6f564f0","metadata":{},"source":["### The binary system\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e57b0094-c3d2-4946-9f0e-02699da70125","metadata":{},"source":["So how would we count if we only had\none finger?  Zero is easy (no finger), one is one finger, but what\nabout 2 and 3, etc.?\n\nSimilar to the above, we can do a table, but this time to the base of 2/\n\n\n| 2<sup>2</sup>|2<sup>1</sup>|2<sup>0</sup>|Value in the decimal system|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|0 * 2<sup>0</sup>|zero|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|1 * 2<sup>0</sup>|one|\n| &nbsp;|1 * 2<sup>1</sup>|0 * 2<sup>0</sup>|two|\n| &nbsp;|1 * 2<sup>1</sup>|0 * 2<sup>0</sup>|three|\n| 1 * 2<sup>2</sup>|0 * 2<sup>1</sup>|0 * 2<sup>0</sup>|four|\n| 1  * 2<sup>2</sup>|0 * 2<sup>1</sup>|1 * 2<sup>0</sup>|five|\n| 1  * 2<sup>2</sup>|1  * 2<sup>1</sup>|0 * 2<sup>0</sup>|six|\n| 1  * 2<sup>2</sup>|1 * 2<sup>1</sup>|1 * 2<sup>0</sup>|seven|\n\nlet's look at the last line in this table, which is similar to the decimal system, can be written as\n\n    1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 which is equal to\n    1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 which is equal to\n    4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nso with three transistor memory cell , we can store numbers from 0 to 7. If we had eight transistors, we could store numbers from zero to 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 -1 = 255. Rather than saying a memory cell is eight transistors wide, it is common to say 8-bit (or 1 byte) wide. \n\nModern computers have memory cells that contain many more cells, typically 64 bits (or 8 byte), which allows them to store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>64</sup> -1.\n\nThe above works well for positive numbers with no fractional part (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). These numbers are called unsigned integers. However, what about storing negative numbers? \n\nTo store a negative integer number, we have to sacrifice one bit, which will now indicate whether the number is positive or negative. These numbers are called signed integers; with those, we can count from -2<sup>63</sup> to +2<sup>63</sup>. \n\nNumbers that have a fractional component are called floating-point numbers (e.g., 1.2345). To store these numbers, we need a way to express them in our binary system. The trick is to decompose them into two integers\n\n    1.2345 = 12345 x 10^{-4} \n\nYou can immediately see that such a number needs double the memory of\nan integer number.\n\nSome computing languages are very particular about these things, e.g., you need to declare that a given memory area will only hold signed integer values. Any attempt to store another number type will result in an error message.\n\nPython is pretty easygoing about this. I.e., if you write `a=1.23` python will know that you are storing a floating-point value. So why do we bother with this in the first place? Imagine you are dealing with very small numbers (say environmental pollution in the ppb range). Then it is important to understand that this number may not be accurately reflected in your code. This is one of the more common problems when you work with computer models.\n\nIt is possible to change the type of a number explicitly; try the\nfollowing example.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"539c77a8-a329-4f29-a263-23270b6a3375","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 20/3  # the result of this division is a floating-point number\nprint(a)  # print the value of a\nint(a)    # convert a into an integer number"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d83a584-8815-4a69-ac53-1d6630d783fe","metadata":{},"source":["There are two things to note here: A) the use of comments.
