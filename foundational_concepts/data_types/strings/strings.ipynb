If you type `a=12.1` python will assign an float-type.\n\nHowever, we can't simply write `a=b` to assign the letter `b` to the variable `a` because `b` could also be the name of a variable.

This implies that there are insufficient mappings to consider special characters, like umlauts, let alone other alphabets.\n\n It is only recently that a globally accepted mapping between numbers and text has become available ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)), but even there, different variants exist, and not every operating system supports them similarly.
