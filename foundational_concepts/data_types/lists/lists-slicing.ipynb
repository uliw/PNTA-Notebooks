The idea is that\nyou execute these code blocks as you read through the text. So treat\nthis notebook as an interactive tutorial rather than a static\ntest. This mode of reading will be the default from now on.\n\n**Note 2:** If you accidentally modify notebook content, go to `File` ->\n`Revert to Checkpoint`, and select the last checkpoint. The system\nshould create a checkpoint the first time you open a notebook. If you\naccidentally delete a notebook, use the link posted in the assignment,\nand restore the notebook.\n\n**Note 3:** Checkpoints are a powerful feature. When you work on your\nassignments, create them every so often so that you do not lose your\nwork. It is good coding practice to create a new checkpoint whenever\nyou solve a minor milestone and before you tackle the following problem.\n\nSo\nfar, we only considered variables which hold a single value. However,\nthe true power of programming stems from the fact that you apply a\ngiven procedure over and over. As such, python provides various\ndata-types that can hold more than one\nvalue.\n\nLists hold a sequence of numbers. However, lists are not\nrestricted to numbers; they can contain numbers, letters, words, and\neven other lists.  You can also mix and match these things in the same\nlist.
