This is a space where we, e.g., store measurement values from an analytical instrument. Often, the values arrive faster than we can process them, but them, there is pause. So wee need to temporarily store the results in such a way, that we can accommodate the first 10 values, but once the buffer is full, we start discarding the oldest data. This principle is called first in, first out (FIFO). Using only the **knowledge learned so far**, write a one line statement that realizes the FIFO principle with a list: E.g.\n\n    a = [0, 0, 0, 0] # this is our empty buffer\n    \n    12 is the first value arriving in the buffer, so it now reads\n    [12, 0, 0, 0] # note that the buffer length has not changed,\n    rather we deleted the right most element \n    \n    -2 is next value arriving from our instrument, so now the buffer \n    looks like this\n    [-2, 12, 0, 0]\n\nHere is a code template. Add a one-line python statement that removes the last list element, shifts all remaining list elements to the right, and adds the new value as the first element in the revised list, so that the new buffer state is `[12, 0, 1, 3]`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"8f31c6d2-3fd6-4bbf-af03-d3b6d526f607","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = [0, 1, 3, 4] # buffer of length 4\nprint(a)\nv = 12 # new value arriving from analytical equipment\n\n# add your one line statement below this comment\n\nprint(a) # verify your result"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c8ff3a0b-fd9c-4dd1-9611-e72627b0a094","metadata":{},"source":["### 2 Joining lists (4 points)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0ca4e59e-bee1-4bd3-b197-c06e2ec6a523","metadata":{},"source":["Consider the following two lists:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"04ef5af8-049e-4ffb-917c-f14e986c34f0","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = [1, 2, 3]\nb = ['John', 'Anna', 'George']"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"555df8c4-7913-4de1-8f7b-87ec27a4a704","metadata":{},"source":["find a python expression that combines the two lists into a single list and prints the result as `[(1, 'John'), (2, 'Anna'), (3, 'George')]` This is not in the textbook and requires that you do some sleuthing on your own with google.

In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
