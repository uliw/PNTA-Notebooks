Without further ado, let's create a new notebook of your own.

If you have followed the previous instructions, you will already have the `my-stuff` directory in your **root** folder. If not, please create it now.\n\nClick on this folder to enter it, and then create a new folder called `submissions`. Enter this folder, and create a new python notebook `assignment-name-firstname-lastname\"` So in my case, this should look like Fig. [ref:name](ref:name)\n\n![img](./figures/first-notebook.png \"You should see the following, but make sure to use your own name\")\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4421cc8f-bc21-4041-9bb9-ad5056f05ea4","metadata":{},"source":["#### Submission Header Information (6 pts)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02d93096-a3d1-4c59-8376-3220f05341a6","metadata":{},"source":["All submissions should start with the following template\n\n    Course Title: (Level 1 heading)\n    Assignment Title:  (Level 2 heading)\n    \n    Date: (bold)\n    \n    First Name:  (bold)\n    \n    Last Name:  (bold)\n    \n    Student ID:  (bold)\n\nAdd the current date, first and last name, student id, etc., in the respective places after the colon.

Since all subsequent assignments will follow the same format, you can save a lot of typing by creating a copy of your notebook. Simply call it `notebook-template.ipynb`.

If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
