A text editor that allows us to write computer code.\n2.  A program that executes our code\n3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n\nThere are many ways to achieve the above, but typically most people use what is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development Environment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDEs available, but most require a local installation. For this course, we will use a web-based IDE, called `Jupyter`, widely used in the sciences and business environments.\n\nIn this unit, you will learn:\n\n1.  How to access a Jupyter server\n2.  How to open a Jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter servers can run locally on your computer, are available commercially for a fee, and some are even available for free (e.g., googles Colab). For this course, we will use a Jupyter server which is provided by Compute Canada and is accessible with your UtorId.\n\nThere are different ways to access your Jupyter account. In this course, we will use this somewhat lengthy URL: [https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/interacting_with_jupyter/interacting_with_jupyter-1.ipynb&branch=main](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/interacting_with_jupyter/interacting_with_jupyter-1.ipynb&branch=main)\n\nIf you look carefully, you see that the first part specifies the Toronto Jupyter server, which is followed by a redirect to a program called git-pull with reference to a GitHub repository I use for the course materials. This line will first authenticate you, then download or update the course materials, and then start your Jupyter interface.\n\nSo if you click on the above link, it should open a browser window. Sometimes this process fails with an error message. See below how to resolve them.) and this will then take you to your UtorId login screen (Fig. [ref:utorid](ref:utorid))\n\n![img](TL-fig-002.png \"The UTorID login screen\")\n\nand finally you should see a screen like the one shown in\nFig. [ref:fig-one>](ref:fig-one>)(but without the `My_Stuff` directory).\n\n![img](screen1.png \"The home screen of your Jupyter session. Note that yours might look slightly different.\")\n\nFor now, don't click on anything, but let's have a look around. If you are unable to see any of the following elements, ask your neighbor, or speak up!\n\nIf you click on the round icon with the white square on the left side , you reach the control panel where you can shutdown processes if need be (we don't need it now, but it will come in handy later). \nIf you click on the folder symbol under the Jupyter Icon (top left), you will open the file browser. To the right of this symbol, you will see the blue plus-sign then a folder symbol with a white plus sign (to create new folders) etc.\nDirectly below you will see a field that displays the current path. The first entry in the path is your root folder, followed by whatever folder you are currently in (the current working folder). \nIf you click on it, you will go to your home (root) folder. You can return to the `PNTA-Notebooks` folder by clicking on the    `PNTA-Notebooks` folder symbol in the file list on the left.\n\n1.  Once you are back in the `PNTA-Notebooks` folder, you should see different files, among them the textbook pdf (`Python_for_non_a_technical_audience.pdf`\n\nLet's make some changes:\n\n1.  Go to your home directory (i.e., one up from PNTA-Notebooks) and in the upper right corner, select `New` and `Folder` see Fig. [ref:nfolder](ref:nfolder)\n\n![img](Screenshot_20200527_124326.png \"Creating a new folder.
