Text areas (often referred to as cells). You can edit these text cells.\n2.  Code blocks (or code cells). These contain computer code that can be executed. You can edit and execute these cells.\n3.  Result Blocks, which contain the output produced by a code block. Results blocks cannot be edited. However, you can select and copy them.\n\n![img](TL-fig-002.png \"An example of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) including text areas, code blocks and result blocks.

Create a new notebook in your `my_stuff` folder. You can do this via the drop-down list called `New` in the upper right corner, and then select `New Notebook`, and rename the new file. These steps should now pose no problem to you. If they do, please speak up!\n\nOnce your new notebook is open, it will look like Fig. [ref:nbfirst](ref:nbfirst). Notice the text `In [ ]:` on the left side. This tells you that this is a code cell that expects python code. So before we start playing with text, we need to change the cell type (see Fig. [ref:celltype](ref:celltype))\n\n![img](Screenshot_20200527_145057.png \"The default view when opening a new notebook.

Go back to these instructions, activate editing mode, and explore how to create the formatting you see (see Fig.ref:mdsyntax) . Now go to your new notebook, and apply the `mark down` syntax in your own notebook. . Remember that you can leave the edit mode any time by hitting `Shift+Enter`.\n\n![img](Screenshot_20200527_153811.png \"Here, you can see how to format your text with `mark down` syntax\")\n\nYou may have noted that the list nesting is achieved by indenting the text after \"This is a simple list\". There are many more formatting options, but for this course, we likely won't need them, but feel free to have a look at [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n\n**Last but not least** save your edits by clicking on the floppy disk icon in the upper left corner. This will create a checkpoint so that you can return to this version at any time! You can retrieve earlier versions with `File->Revert Notebook from Checkpoint` . Best to create a new checkpoint before doing so, in case you want to return to the current version!\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d88b91a2-c0b8-4d75-9e73-fdcca120d5a8","metadata":{},"source":["### Adding Code cells\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb0c4a13-0769-4414-83f9-7e5f72707b9a","metadata":{},"source":["Now let's try adding a code cell below the text cell and enter a trivial statement like `1 + 1` and hit `Shift+Enter` and you should see the result displayed below the code cell (hopefully, it is 2).
