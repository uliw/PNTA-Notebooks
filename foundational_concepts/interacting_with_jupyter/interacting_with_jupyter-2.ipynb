Text areas (often referred to as cells). You can edit these text cells.\n2.  Code blocks (or code cells). These contain computer code that can\n    be executed. You can edit and execute these cells.\n3.  Result Blocks, which contain the output produced by a code\n    block. Results blocks cannot be edited. However, you can select and\n    copy them.\n\n![img](./Tianshi/TL-fig-003.png \"An example of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) including text areas, code blocks and result blocks.

These steps should now pose no problem to you. If they do, please speak up!\n\nOnce your new notebook is open, it will look like\nFig. [ref:nbfirst](ref:nbfirst). Notice the text `In [ ]:` on the left side. This\ntells you that this is a code cell that expects python code. So before\nwe start playing with text, we need to change the cell type (see Fig. [ref:celltype](ref:celltype))\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_145057.png \"The default view when opening a new notebook.

Go back to these instructions, activate editing mode, and explore how to create the formatting you see (see Fig.[ref:mdsyntax](ref:mdsyntax)) .
