Add the usual pre-amble (Title, Name,\nDate, student id etc.). (2 pts)\n\nUse the following strings for this exercise\n\n    s_1 = \"This is the first string\"\n    s_2 = \"This is the second string\"\n    s_3 = \"just some random letters\"\n\nIn order to solve the questions below you need to use your knowledge\nabout how to manipulate lists (i.e., ranges), and how to query the\nmethods provided by a string object. For each of the following\nQuestions, please add a text box (or comment), which states the question\nnumber (and preferably the question as well). Again, do not type your results,\ninstead write code, which yields the requires results.\n\n1.  Provide some code which adds a comma to the end of `s_1` (2pts)\n2.  Using your knowledge about ranges, rewrite `s_1` in such a way\n    that the comma is being removed (i.e., `s_1 = s_1....` )  (1pts)\n3.  Provide a code example which combines these 3 strings into a new\n    string `s_4` using the `+` operator (1pts)\n4.  Using the same approach, rewrite this example in a such away that\n    the resulting `s_4` has proper commas and blanks after each\n    substring. Your result should look like this example `\"This is the\n        first string, This is the second string, just some random letters\"` (typing it does not\n    count).  (2pts)\n5.  Use a string-object method which will split your string into 3\n    lines. Store the result in `s_5` Your results should look like\n    this.\n    \n        ['This is the first string',\n         'This is the second string',\n         'just some random letters']\n    \n    pay attention to the location of the commas, and the justification\n    on the left. If it does look very different, consider the next\n    question first. (2 pts)\n6.  Explain whether your method changes data in place and why it \n    makes a difference when you use a print statement to show the result. (2 pts)\n7.  Provide a statement which fixes the capitalization in `s_4`. Note,\n    your statement should replace the capitalization in `s_4`, so that\n    you do not start with a capital letter after the first comma. Add\n    `print(s_4)` to show the result of your operation. The idea is\n    that you do this with a single call using a string method. (1pts)\n8.  Provide a one-line statement which removes all blanks from\n    `s_4`. Add `print(s_4)` to show the result of your operation.  (1pts)\n9.  Provide a one-line statement using a string method which adds\n    blanks after each comma in `s_4`. Add `print(s_4)` to show the\n    result of your operation.  (1pts)\n\nTotal points: 15\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it.

If not, please\nspeak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I\ncan guarantee that you if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least\nhalf the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it `ipyn` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. Please submit both files on Quercus. Note\nthat the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid\nmarkup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is\ncomplete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems,\nplease contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Do not type your answers by hand. Rather, write code which**\n**produces the answer, and your pdf should show the code as well as**\n**the results of the code execution!**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
