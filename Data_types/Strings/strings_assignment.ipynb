For each of the following questions,\nplease insert a new cell below each question. If necessary, review how\nto split an existing notebook cell and how to insert a new cell.\n\nYour code should first define all the variables used in the cell, then\ncontinue with the python statements to yield the required results.\n\n1.  Provide some code that adds a comma to the end of `s_1` (2 pts)\n\n2.  Use slicing syntax to remove the comma at the end of `s_4`\n    (2 pts)\n\n3.  Provide a code example which combines `s_1`, `s_2`, and `s_3`  into a new\n    string `s_5` using the `+` operator (2 pts)\n4.  Do the same, but this time make sure the resulting string has\n    commas and blanks after each sub-string. Store the result in `s_6`. Your result should look\n    like this example `\"This is the first string, This is the second string, just some random letters\"` (typing it does not count).\n    (2 pts)\n5.  Use a string-object method that will split `s_6` into 3\n    sub-strings (use the comma as a separator).  Store the result in\n    `x`. 2 pts\n\n6.  Use the `type()` function to query the variable type of `x`, and\n    `x[1]`. 2 pts\n\n7.  Use a string method that replaces all \"i\" characters in `s_1` with \"y\" 2 pts\n\n8.  Provide code that extracts the file name and the file-type extension from `my_excel_spreadsheet.xls` 2 pts\n\n9.  Strip the 4 rightmost characters from `a = \"123456\"` 2 pts\n\n10. Strip the 4 leftmost characters from `a = \"123456\"` 2 pts\n\n11. Typing a list containing strings is tedious, e.g., `a = [\"g\", \"h\", \"e\", \"l\"]` Can you think of a way to create the same list with less typing? 2 pts\n\n12. Write a one-function statement that counts the numbers of\n    characters, including blanks in `s_1` (do not use loops, etc.!). 2  pts\n\n13. Chain two functions/methods to count the numbers of characters in `s_1`\n    without blanks in `s_1` (do not use loops etc.!). 2 pts\n\n14. Chain two functions/methods to count the number of words in `s_1` 2 pts\n\n15. We can access list elements by a numeric index. Conversely,\n    dictionaries allow us to access elements using a key. Write\n    python code that creates a dictionary containing mineral names as\n    key (e.g., Barite) and the respective chemical formula as value\n    (e.g., BaSO4). Your dictionary should contain data for Barite,\n    Pyrite (FeS2) and Gypsum (CaSO 4Â·2H2O) (3 pts). Using your\n    dictionary, write a print statement that prints the formula for\n    barite. 1 pt\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Advanced Questions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.  Use string methods to write code that separates the path name from the file name\n    (including the filename extension) in variable `a = \"/home/user/Downloads/my_excel_spreadsheet.xl\"` Your code should\n    have no more than three lines, including the two print statements (each\n    on their own line). 4 pts\n2.  Extend your mineral dictionary also to hold additional\n    information, in this case, the location of the respective\n    Wikipedia page.

In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\n Please submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf\nexport can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code.

If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
