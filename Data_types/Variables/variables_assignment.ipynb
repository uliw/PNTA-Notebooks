Let's take a closer look to understand what happened here:\n\nWhen you hit `shift+enter`, you send the commands you have typed into\nthe code cell to the python interpreter. This is just another computer\nprogram that will read your commands and try to make sense of\nit. Before running your code, the interpreter will do some sanity\nchecks, and in the above case, it finds that the variable \"A\" was\nnever defined. It thus prints:\n\n1.  a red box\n2.  the type of error, in this case, \"NameError\" and some context:\n3.  The cell in which the error occurred\n4.  The line in which the error occurred\n5.  the last couple of lines before the error occurred\n6.  and if you are lucky, some useful information on why the error occurred\n\nIn your assignment, add a text cell below the code cell with the\nerror, with the following content (note, you create linebreaks by\nadding two spaces at the end of each line)\n\n    ErrorName  = \n    Cell Number = \n    Line Number where the error occurred = \n    Explanation of error type = \n\nand add the data you get from the actual error message after the equal\nsigns.
