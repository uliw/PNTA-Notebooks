Before we learn the basics of data\nmanipulation, we need to understand how data is stored.\n\nOn its most basic level, a computer resembles a library (you have been\nto the library, right?). There are vast amounts of storage space, a\ncatalog where we can look up where a specific book is stored, a librarian who will move books around and do other maintenance tasks,\nand a user who manipulates the information in those books, and who\nmight writes a new book that eventually goes back into the library.\n\nBooks can be found using a rather specific way of writing their\naddress in the library storage which, e.g., could read \n`QA76.17.C4672012`.\n\nSimilarly, the information in a computer can be retrieved by using equally\ncryptic schemes, e.g., `0x5560b128f480`. The `0x` at the beginning\ntells us that this is a number to the base of 16, which after\nconversion into our 10-based system indicates that the\nrespective data is stored in the 93873777472640<sup>th</sup> memory\ncell. It is cumbersome to keep these alphanumeric sequences\nin mind. This is where variables come into play. Rather then saying\nstore the number 4 at location `0x5560b128f480` we can simply say\n\"assign the value of 4 to the variable a\". Let's try this and execute\nthe following statement doing a left-click in the following cell, and\nhit `shift+enter`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 4"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This will produce no output, but you will have assigned the value of 4\nto the variable `a`.

While there are\ncomputing environments that can do symbolic math \n, the above example is an entirely different beast. In symbolic\nmath, the expression `a = b` is equal to the expression `b = a`. Not\nso in coding (try e.g., `a = 4` vs `4 = a`).  Remember that writing\n`a = 4` means take the value of 4, store it into memory, and give this\nmemory location the name \"a\". A better way to write this would be `a\n<- 4`.\n\nLikewise the expression `a+a` means retrieve the value stored at\nlocation \"a\" and do an addition with the value stored at location\n\"a\". So the \"a\" is merely a reference to a memory location.  Note that\nthere is nothing specific about calling this \"a\", You could equally\nwrite `myfirstvariablename = 4` but it is a lot of typing.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Operators\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\nThe `+` sign is called an operator.

However, all variables:\n\n1.  Must start with a letter\n2.  can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores\n    (i.e., no blank spaces or special symbols)\n3.  You cannot use the minus sign (or dash) to make a compound\n    name. Compound names should always be connected by an\n    underscore. i.e., `student_id` rather than `student-id` which would\n    be interpreted as `student` minus `id`\n\nIn addition, I recommend adhering to the following guidelines:\n\n1.  Avoid variable names that are too general or too wordy. E.g.,\n    rather than `my_first_variable` call it `length` or any other\n    descriptive term.\n2.  Avoid letters like \"I\" or \"O\" where it is hard to know whether you\n    mean lowercase \"i\", upper case \"I\", or the number \"1\", similarly,\n    \"O\" is easily confused with zero.\n3.  Variables names should always be lower case\n4.  And it is always a good idea to add some comments which explain\n    what your variable means (more on this later).\n5.
