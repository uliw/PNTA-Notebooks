There are two ways to do this. The first approach uses the python command `type()`. For each of the above variables write a print statement which outputs the name, type and value of the variable similar to the following example (6 pts)\n\n    The variable my_int is of type int and equals 1234\n\nNote that I don't want you to write `print(\"The variable my__int is of\ntype int and equals 1234\")` rather use a print statement with\nf-strings where `type` and value are inserted in the appropriate\nplaces. Please use the correct format modifiers to obtain `1.234`\nrather than `1.23400000` (2 pts)\n\nThe second way to verify your variable types will only work inside\njupyter Notebooks.
