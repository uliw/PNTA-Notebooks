So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it `ipyn` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. Please submit both files on Quercus. Note\nthat the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid\nmarkup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is\ncomplete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems,\nplease contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Do not type your answers by hand. Rather, write code which**\n**produces the answer, and your pdf should show the code as well as**\n**the results of the code execution!**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
