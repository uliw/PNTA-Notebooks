At their heart,\nthey consist of two layers of thin silicon with additional electrons\nin the crystal lattice and a thin layer of silicon missing some\nelectrons (or vice versa). This thin layer acts as an insulator and\nprevents any current flow (see the sketch below). However, if we add a\nsmall current to this layer, we will move some electrons into the thin\nlayer, which will take the space of the missing electrons in the crystal\nlattice, and now the current can flow between the two outer layers until\nwe remove the control current again - hence the term semiconductor. See\nthis [youtube link](https://youtu.be/7ukDKVHnac4) for a detailed explanation.\n\n![img](transitor.png)\n\nFor our purposes, a transistor can be thought of as a simple switch that\neither lets an electrical current pass or not. As such, the transistor can\nreflect the numbers 0 (nothing passes) or 1 (everything passes). So with a\nsingle transistor, we can count two numbers (0, 1).  Now, if we add another\ntransistor, we should be able to count to four. However, since each\ntransistor is either on or off, we need to express numbers in a binary\nsystem (i.e., a number system, which only knows two numbers, zero and\none).\n\nLet's consider how we count. We have 10 fingers that we can use to\ncount from 0 to 9. However, what happens if we need to count past 9?\n\n\n| 100-999|10-99|0-9|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|8|eight|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|9|nine|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|ten|\n| &nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|9|9|ninty nine|\n| 1|0|0|one hundred|\n\nSo each time we run out of fingers (counting apples, e.g.), we add a\nnumber to the left, which tells us that we already have ten (or\ntwenty, thirty) apples, which we have to add to the current number of\nfingers. So we are counting in batches of 10. A more scientific way to\nsay this is counting to the base of 10. We can rewrite the above table\nas\n\n\n| 10<sup>2</sup>|10<sup>1</sup>|10<sup>0</sup>|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|8|eight|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|9|nine|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|ten|\n| &nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|9|9|ninty nine|\n| 1|0|0|one hundred|\n\nwhere you would have to multiply the table header with the column\nvalue, e.g., \n\n    10^0 x 8 = 1 x 8 = 8\n\nlet's try this with row 7\n\n    9 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^0 = 90 + 9 = 99\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### The binary system\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" So how would we count if we only had\none finger?  Zero is easy (no finger), one is one finger, but what\nabout 2 and 3, etc.?\n\nSimilar to the above, we can do a table, but this time to the base of 2/\n\n\n| 2<sup>2</sup>|2<sup>1</sup>|2<sup>0</sup>|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|0|zero|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|1|one|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|two|\n| &nbsp;|1|1|three|\n| 1|0|0|four|\n| 1|0|1|five|\n| 1|1|0|six|\n| 1|1|1|seven|\n\nlet's look at the last line in this table, which is similar to the\ndecimal system, can be written as\n\n    1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 which is equal to\n    1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 which is equal to\n    4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nso with three transistor memory cell , we can store\nnumbers from 0 to 7. If we had eight transistors, we could store\nnumbers from zero to 2<sup>8</sup> = 255. Rather than saying a memory cell is eight transistors wide, it is\ncommon to say 8-bit (or 1 byte) wide. \n\nModern computers have memory cells that contain many more cells,\ntypically 64 bits (or 8 byte), which allows them to store numbers from 0\nto 2<sup>64</sup>. \n\nThe above works well for positive numbers with no\nfractional part (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). These numbers are called\nunsigned integers. However, what about storing negative numbers?\n\nTo store a negative integer number, we have to sacrifice one\nbit, which will now indicate whether the number is positive or\nnegative. These numbers are called signed integers; with those, we\ncan count from -2<sup>63</sup> to +2<sup>63</sup>. \n\nNumbers that have a fractional component are called floating-point\n numbers (e.g., 1.2345). To store these numbers, we\nneed a way to express them in our binary system. The trick is to\ndecompose them into two integers\n\n    1.2345 = 12345 x 10^{-4} \n\nYou can immediately see that such a number needs double the memory of\nan integer number.\n\nSome computing languages are very particular about these things, e.g.,\nyou need to declare that a given memory area will only hold signed\ninteger values. Any attempt to store another number type will\nresult in an error message.\n\nPython is pretty easygoing about this. I.e., if you write `a=1.23`\npython will know that you are storing a floating-point value. So why\ndo we bother with this in the first place? Imagine you are dealing\nwith very small numbers (say environmental pollution in the ppb\nrange). Then it is important to understand that this number may not be\naccurately reflected in your code. This is one of the more\ncommon problems when you work with computer models.\n\nIt is possible to change the type of a number explicitly; try the\nfollowing example.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 20/3  # the result of this division is a floating-point number\nprint(a)  # print the value of a\nint(a)    # convert a into an integer number"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["There are two things to note here: A) the use of\ncomments.
