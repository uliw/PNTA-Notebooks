This is a space where we, e.g., store measurement values from an analytical instrument. Often, the values arrive faster than we can process them, but them, there is pause. So wee need to temporarily store the results in such a way, that we can accommodate the first 1000 values, but once the buffer is full, we start discarding the oldest data. This principle is called first in, last out (FIFO). Using only the **knowledge learned so far**, write a one line statement that realizes the FIFO principle with a list: E.g.\n\n    a = [0, 0, 0, 0] # this is our empty buffer\n    \n    12 is the first value arriving in the buffer, so it now reads\n    [12, 0, 0, 0] # note that the buffer length has not changed,\n    rather we deleted the right most element \n    \n    -2 is next value arriving from our instrument, so now the buffer \n    looks like this\n    [-2, 12, 0, 0]\n\nHere is a code template. Add a one-line python statement that removes the last list element, shifts all remaining list elements to the right, and adds the new value as the first element in the revised list, so that the new buffer state is `[12, 0, 1, 3]`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0d636473-5dc1-4bbf-a2b5-ce793682af65","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = [0, 1, 3, 4] # buffer of length 4\nprint(a)\nv = 12 # new value arriving from analytical equipment\n# add your one line statement below this comment\n\nprint(a) # verify your result"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c81f0494-2adf-4561-83c3-337fbd436a2f","metadata":{},"source":["### 2\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"90f7f7f1-948c-4257-bd0b-5fd387dd9c6d","metadata":{},"source":["Consider the following two lists:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"b3492af3-407c-4fdc-b46f-75fb0025ffae","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = [1, 2, 3]\nb = ['John', 'Anna', 'George']"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"47114eeb-4d7e-46ca-b816-a4cb96ee6e0d","metadata":{},"source":["find a python expression that combines the two lists into a single list and prints the result as `[(1, 'John'), (2, 'Anna'), (3, 'George')]` This is not in the textbook and requires that you do some sleuthing on your own.
