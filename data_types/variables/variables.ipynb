Before we learn the basics of data manipulation, we need to understand how data is stored.\n\nOn its most basic level, a computer resembles a library (you have been to the library, right?). There are vast amounts of storage space, a catalog where we can look up where a specific book is stored, a librarian who will move books around and do other maintenance tasks, and a user who manipulates the information in those books, and who might writes a new book that eventually goes back into the library.\n\nBooks can be found using a rather specific way of writing their address in the library storage which, e.g., could read `QA76.17.C4672012`.\n\nSimilarly, the information in a computer can be retrieved by using equally cryptic schemes, e.g., `0x5560b128f480`. The `0x` at the beginning tells us that this is a number to the base of 16, which after conversion into our 10-based system indicates that the respective data is stored in the 93873777472640<sup>th</sup> memory cell. It is cumbersome to keep these alphanumeric sequences in mind. This is where variables come into play. Rather then saying store the number 4 at location `0x5560b128f480` we can simply say \"assign the value of 4 to the variable a\".

There are also tools which will detect naming conflicts (so called linters) but they are not installed on syzygy.\n\nIn addition, I recommend adhering to the following guidelines:\n\n1.  Avoid variable names that too wordy. E.g., rather than `my_first_variable` call it `length` or any other descriptive term.\n2.  Avoid letters like `I` or `O` where it is hard to know whether you mean lowercase `i`, upper case `I`, or the number `1`, similarly, `O` is easily confused with zero.\n3.  Never use special characters or foreign alphabets (more on this later)\n4.  I prefer variable names in lower case, it is less effort to type these.\n5.  And it is always a good idea to add some comments which explain what your variable means (more on this later).\n6.
