For each of the following questions, please insert a new cell below each question. If necessary, review how to split an existing notebook cell and how to insert a new cell.\n\nYour code should first define all the variables used in the cell, then continue with the python statements to yield the required results.\n\n1.  Provide some code that adds a comma to the end of `s_1` (2 points)\n2.  Use slicing syntax to remove the comma at the end of `s_1` and `s_4`.\n    (2 points)\n    1.  Provide a code example which combines `s_1`, `s_2`, and `s_3` into a new string `s_5` using the `+` operator (2 points)\n3.  Do the same, but this time make sure the resulting string has commas and blanks after each sub-string. Store the result in `s_6`. Your result should look like this example `\"This is the first string, This is the second string, just some random letters\"` (typing it does not count). (2 points)\n4.  Use a string-object method that will split `s_6` into 3 sub-strings (use the comma as a separator). Store the result in `x`. 2 points\n5.  Use the `type()` function to query the variable type of `x`, and `x[1]`. 2 points\n6.  Use a string method that replaces all \"i\" characters in `s_1` with \"y\" 2 points\n7.  Provide code that extracts the file name and the file-type extension from `my_excel_spreadsheet.xls` 2 points\n8.  Strip the 4 rightmost characters from `a = \"123456\"` Do not store the result. 2 points\n9.  Strip the 4 leftmost characters from `a = \"123456\"` Do not store the result 2 points\n10. Typing a list containing strings is tedious, e.g., `a = [\"g\", \"h\", \"e\", \"l\"]`. Can you think of a way to create the same list with less typing? 2 points\n11. Write a one-function statement that counts the numbers of characters, including blanks in `s_1` (do not use loops, etc.!). 2 points\n12. Chain two functions/methods to count the numbers of characters in `s_1` without blanks in `s_1` (do not use loops etc.!). 2 points\n13. Chain two functions/methods to count the number of words in `s_1` 2 points\n14. We can access list elements by a numeric index. Conversely, dictionaries allow us to access elements using a key. Write python code that creates a dictionary containing mineral names as key (e.g., Barite) and the respective chemical formula as value (e.g., BaSO4). Your dictionary should contain data for Barite, Pyrite (FeS2) and Gypsum (CaSO 4Â·2H2O) (3 points).\n15. Using your dictionary, write a print statement that prints the formula for barite. 1 pt\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d103060d-584c-4bde-9a96-7021b1550202","metadata":{},"source":["### Advanced Questions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"16c7dc23-b395-4fb8-9792-8fe00f33681a","metadata":{},"source":["1.

Extend your mineral dictionary also to hold additional information, in this case, the location of the respective Wikipedia page.

Otherwise, your edits may be overwritten the\nnext time you log into syzygy. Please name your copy `assignment-name-firstname-lastname` \n\n-   Replace the `assignment-name` with the name of the assignment\n    (i.e., the filename of the respective Jupyter Notebook)\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable\n    with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board\n    and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel\n    uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the\n    same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. **To export your notebook as pdf\nuse your browser's print function (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select**\n`Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf\nexport can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So\nyou need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss\nany sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\nNote: If you re-submit your file, Quercus will add a version number to your\nfilename. This is OK, nothing to worry about!\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code and the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
