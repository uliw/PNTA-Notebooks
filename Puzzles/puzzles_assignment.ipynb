All the below exercises require\nyou to create some python code that will match the output pattern\nshown in the particular question. The goal is to create these patterns\nwith one or more loop statements (including loops that use the\nrange function - if in doubt, go back to the previous chapters - note,\nyour lecture script has an index).
