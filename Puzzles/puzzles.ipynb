And the only way out is to hit the \"ok, let's be creative\nbutton\". For some of you, this will work. For others, not so much,\nsince few of us are trained or gifted creative thinkers. That\nbeing said, there are strategies you can employ that will help you to\nfind solutions. You will need those strategies in pretty much all of\nthe following coding projects.\n\nThis chapter is inspired by \"Think like a Programmer\"\nby V. A. Spraul. Unlike most programming books, it focuses on\nproblem-solving rather than computing. Unfortunately, all its\nexercises are in `C++`, but the introductory and conclusions chapters\nare highly recommended reading.\n\nThe book's basic premise is that most students do not struggle\nwith a computing language per se but rather with the process of using\na program to solve a problem. The following chapter is a heavily\ncondensed version of Chapter 1 in Spraul's book.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### General Problem-Solving Strategies\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\\index{Problem Solving Strategies}\nProblem-solving skills vary tremendously between people, and it is not\nsomething you can learn like any other method because it is an\ninherently creative process, not a methodical one. However, you will\nget better with practice, and a few guidelines can help\nwith the process. The following list will prove helpful whenever you\nstruggle with a problem where there is no obvious solution:\n\n**Make have a plan:** Even if you don't know what is going on, you can\nalways write down a plan. Think of mapping, you may not have the\nfaintest clue of what you are dealing with, but you know that by\nmethodical mapping (taking stations, measure strike and dip, map\nperpendicular to strike, etc.), you will zero in on the solution. The\nsame is true for programming.  Use the following steps as a guideline\nto develop a plan. Start by making a list of steps you need, even\nthough you may not know how to solve each step.  You will likely\nhave to refine your ideas as you go, but this is still infinitely more\nuseful than just random exploration.\n\n1.  **Restate the Problem:** An excellent way to achieve this is to restate\n    the problem in your own words. Next, explain how you see the task to one of your peers (or your instructor) for comments. This is often the first\n    and most crucial step in formulating a plan. Remember to\n    describe the goal, not the way.\n2.  **Divide the Problem:** Most complex problems can be understood as a\n    series of smaller problems. In coding terms, we would think of\n    loops, if-statements, etc&#x2026; This is the part where you start\n    writing high-level pseudo-code. Pseudo-code is like short form,\n    but it is not actual code:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["while loop to get user input\n  y = input\n\nfor loop to test x>y\nt = transform_magic(x,y)\nprint result"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You can do this even though you may not yet know how to code the individual blocks.\n\n3.  **Start with what you know:** This is like writing an exam. Always\n    start with the pieces you already know how to solve. In doing so,\n    you may find essential clues on how to solve the pieces you don't\n    know.\n4.  **Reduce the Problem:** Say you have to write code that\n    converts any number into its binary notation. To simplify\n    the problem, you can state that your function will only deal with\n    positive integers. Or you can further simplify the problem to the\n    point that your code will only deal with numbers between 0 and\n    10 etc. Once you have an intermediate solution, you will have\n    gained much clarity on how to solve the entire problem or\n    what specific questions to ask your peers or instructor.\n5.  **Look for Analogies:** Often, you may be able to reduce your problem\n    so that you can recognize that you already solved a\n    similar problem elsewhere. Consider the case of strings, which are\n    just a specific type of lists. The exact commands may not match,\n    but now you probably remember how to query the methods associated\n    with a list object or that you need to ask the specific question\n    \"how do I replace the third element in a string\".\n6.  **Experiment:** Often, it is useful to test the workings of a command\n    or code sequence in a separate cell.  The key techniques here are\n    the idea to isolate the code snippet from your main code, and to\n    test whether it does what you think it does. E.g.,\n    consider the following `a[3]: str = 4`. This may work well in\n    your code, but it may not do what you expect. So a little\n    experiment can go a long way&#x2026; Similarly, test\n    and explore new commands before adding them to your code.\n\n7.  **Don't get frustrated:** When you are frustrated, you won't think\n    clearly, and everything will take twice as long.  Take a walk,\n    rethink the problem (i.e., use the above steps), and come back\n    to the problem when you are ready. Then, you can try to reduce\n    the problem to it's most fundamental form, e.g., take a piece\n    of the code out of your program and run it in isolation; use\n    print statements to check whether your variables have indeed\n    the values you think they have. Once you have a minimal example\n    that shows the problem, ask for help. Or if all else fail, have\n    a look at your plan and see if you can work on something else.\n    If need be, take a creative break and work on something else\n    for a while.
