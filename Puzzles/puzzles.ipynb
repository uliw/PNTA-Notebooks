    "get better with practice, and there are a few guidelines that can help\n",
    "with the process. The following list will prove helpful whenever you\n",
    "struggle with a problem where there is no obvious solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Always have a plan:** Even if you don't know what is going on, you\n",
    "    can always have one. Think of mapping, you may not have the\n",
    "    faintest clue of what you are dealing with, but you know that by\n",
    "    methodical mapping (taking stations, measure strike and dip, map\n",
    "    perpendicular to strike etc.), you will zero in on the\n",
    "    solution. The same is true for programming.  Start out by making a\n",
    "    list of steps you need, even so you may not know how to program\n",
    "    each step.  You will likely have to refine your ideas as you go,\n",
    "    but this is still infinitely more useful than just random\n",
    "    exploration.\n",
    "2.  **Restate the Problem:** An excellent way to achieve this is to restate\n",
    "    the problem in your own words. Next, explain how you see the task to one of your\n",
    "    peers, or your instructor for comments. This is often the first\n",
    "    and most crucial step in formulating a plan. Remember to\n",
    "    describe the goal, not the way.\n",
    "3.  **Divide the Problem:** Most complex problems can be understood as a\n",
    "    series of smaller problems. In coding terms, we would think of\n",
    "    loops, conditionals, and functions. This is the part where you\n",

    "    you may find essential clues on how to solve the pieces you don't\n",
    "    know.\n",

    "    converts any number into its binary notation. To simplify\n",
    "    the problem, you can state that your function will only deal with\n",
    "    positive integers. Or you can further simplify the problem to the\n",

    "    gained much clarity how to solve the full problem, or\n",
    "    what specific questions to ask your peers or instructor.\n",
    "6.  **Look for Analogies:** Often, you may be able to reduce your problem\n",
    "    in such a way that you can recognize that you already solved a\n",
    "    similar problem elsewhere. Consider the case of strings, which are\n",
    "    just a specific type of lists. The exact commands may not match,\n",
    "    but now you probably remember how to query the methods associated\n",
    "    with a list object, or that you need to ask the specific question\n",
    "    of \"how do I replace the third element in a string\".\n",
    "7.  **Experiment:** Often, it is useful to test the workings of a command\n",
    "    or code sequence in a separate cell.  The key techniques here are\n",
    "    the idea to isolate the code snippet from your main code, and to\n",
    "    test whether it actually does what you think it does. E.g.,\n",
    "    consider the following `a[3] :str` 4=. This may very well work in\n",
    "    your code, but it may not do what you expect. So a little\n",
    "    experiment can go a long way&#x2026; Similarly, with new commands, test\n",
    "    and explore their use elsewhere before adding them to your code.\n",
    "8.  **Don't get frustrated:** When you are frustrated, you won't think\n",
    "    clearly, and everything will take twice as long.  Take a walk,\n",
    "    rethink the problem (i.e., use the above steps), and come back to\n",
    "    the problem when you are ready. Then, you can try to reduce the\n",
    "    problem to it's most fundamental form, e.g., take the code out of\n",
    "    the function and run it in isolation, use print statements to\n",
    "    check whether your function parameters are indeed arriving inside\n",
    "    your function in the way you think. Once you have a minimal\n",
    "    example that shows the problem, ask for help. Or if all else fail,\n",
    "    have a look at your plan and see if you can work on something\n",
