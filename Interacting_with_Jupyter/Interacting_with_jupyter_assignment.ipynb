Without further ado, let's create a new notebook of\nyour own. **Since all content in the PNTA-Notebooks folder is downloaded from**\n**another computer (and may thus be overwritten or deleted) we must\ntake** **care that our notebooks are created outside this\ndirectory**.  If you have followed the previous instructions, you will\nalready have the `My_Stuff` directory in your root folder. If not,\nplease create it now. \n\nClick on this folder to enter it, and then create a new folder called\n `My_PNTA-Notebooks_Submissions`. Enter this folder, and left-click on the\n `New` button in the upper right corner. Select `Python 3` to create a\n new python notebook. Once the new notebook has opened, left-click on\n `File` and then select \"Rename\" and name your file according to the\n following Scheme\n\n`FirstName-Lastname-text-edit-assignment`\nSo in my case, this should look like Fig. [name](name)\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200528_101944.png \"You should see the following, but make sure to use your own name\")\n\nIn the middle of the menu bar, you will see the word `Code` just right\nof the double right arrow. This box tells you that the first (and\ncurrently empty cell) is a code box. You can change the cell type to\n`Markdown` by left-clicking on `Code`, or by using the `Cell` menu.\n\n1.  Go ahead and change it to \"Markdown\".\n2.  Now add the following text to this cell: \"ESS245 Computational Geology Text Cell Assignment\"\n3.  Save your edits by hitting `shift+enter`\n4.  Select this cell again (double left click) and now modify the text\n    using markdown syntax in such a way that it becomes a level 1\n    heading (see above).\n\nIf you already have a new cell below the heading, change it to\nmarkdown mode (see above), or insert a new cell \n(`Insert -> Cell below`) and change it to markdown afterward.\n\nIn this cell, add the following text\n\n    Course Title:\n    Assignment Name: \n    \n    Date: \n    \n    First Name:\n    \n    Last Name:\n    \n    Student ID:\n\nAdd the current date, first and last name, student id, etc., in the respective places\nafter the colon. Now change the formatting so that the text\nbefore the colon is set in bold, whereas your personal info uses \na regular font.\n\nThis should look like this\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200921_111320.png \"Formatting example for your notebook submission\")\n\nNow is a good time to save your notebook! Since all\nsubsequent assignments will follow the same format, you can save\na lot of typing by creating a copy of your notebook. Simply\ncall it `Notebook_Template.ipynb`. So for the next assignment, you can\nsimply copy the template.\n\nNext, go back to your notebook, and add the following elements\n\n-   a new text cell that contains a numbered list of your three most favored foods\n-   a new text cell that contains a bullet list of your three most favored foods\n-   a new text cell that contains the first sentence as a first-level\n    heading, the second sentence as a second-level heading, and your\n    name as a third-level heading.\n    1.  The pleasures and tribulations of writing with markdown syntax:\n    2.  An Essay by Add your name here\n    3.

The best way to export your notebook as\npdf is to select `print`, and then `print to pdf`.  Please submit\nboth files on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file\ncontains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf\nexport is complete and does not miss any sections.
