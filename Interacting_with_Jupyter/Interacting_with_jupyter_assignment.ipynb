Without further ado, let's create a new notebook of\nyour own. **Since all content in the ESS345 folder is downloaded from**\n**another computer (and may thus be overwritten or deleted) we must\ntake** **care that our own notebooks are created outside of this\ndirectory**.  If you have followed the previous instructions, you will\nalready have the `My_Stuff` directory in your root folder. If not,\nplease create it now. \n\nClick on this folder to enter it, and then create a new folder called\n `My_ESS345_Submissions`. Enter this folder, and left-click on the\n `New` button in the upper right corner. Select `Python 3` to create a\n new python notebook. Once the new notebook has opened, left-click on\n `File` and then select \"Rename\" and name your file according to the\n following Scheme\n\n`FirstName-Lastname-text-edit-assignment`\nSo in my case, this should look like Fig. [name](#name)\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200528_101944.png \"You should see following, but make sure to use your own name\")\n\nIn the middle of the menu bar, you will see the word `Code` just right\nof the double right arrow. This box tells you that the first (and\ncurrently empty cell) is a code box. You can change the cell type to\n`Markdown` by left-clicking on `Code`, or by using the `Cell` menu.\n\n1.  Go ahead and change it to \"Markdown\"\n2.  Now add the following text to this cell: \"ESS345 Computational Geology Text Cell Assignment\"\n3.  Save your edits by hitting `shift+enter`\n4.  Select this cell again (double left click) and now modify the text\n    using markdown syntax in such a way that it becomes a level 1\n    heading (see above).\n\nIf you already have a new cell below the heading, change it to\nmarkdown mode (see above), or insert a new cell \n(`Insert -> Cell below`) and change it to markdown afterward.\n\nIn this cell, add the following text\n\n    Date: \n    \n    First Name:\n    \n    Last Name:\n    \n    Student Id:\n\nAdd the current date, your first and last name, and your student id\nafter the colon. Now change the formatting in such a way that the text\nbefore the colon is set in bold, whereas your personal info is set in\na regular font.\n\nThis should look something like this\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200921_111320.png \"Formatting example for your notebook submission\")\n\nFollow the previous instructions and save your notebook, and download\nit in `Notebook` and `pdf` format, and submit on Quercus.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Last but not least\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Review the learning outcomes above, and consider whether you feel\nconfident about all of them.
