Without further ado, let's create a new notebook of\nyour own.  Use this link to log into the Jupyter Notebook server:\n\n[https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/Interacting_with_Jupyter/Interacting_with_jupyter-2.ipynb&branch=main](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/Interacting_with_Jupyter/Interacting_with_jupyter-2.ipynb&branch=main)\n\n**Since all content in the PNTA-Notebooks folder is downloaded from**\n**another computer (and may thus be overwritten or deleted) we must\ntake** **care that our notebooks are created outside the PNTA-Notebooks \ndirectory**.  If you have followed the previous instructions, you will\nalready have the `my-stuff` directory in your **root** folder. If not,\nplease create it now. \n\nClick on this folder to enter it, and then create a new folder called\n `my-pnta-notebooks-submissions`. Enter this folder, and create a\n new python notebook `assignment-name-firstname-lastname\"` \nSo in my case, this should look like Fig. [name](name)\n\n![img](./figures/first-notebook.png \"You should see the following, but make sure to use your own name\")\n\nIn the middle of the menu bar, you will see the word `Code` just right\nof the double right arrow. This box tells you that the first (and\ncurrently empty cell) is a code box. You can change the cell type to\n`Markdown` by left-clicking on `Code`, or by using the `Cell` menu.\n\n1.  Go ahead and change it to \"Markdown\".\n2.  Now add the following text to this cell: \"ESS245 Computational Geology Text Edit Assignment\"\n3.  Save your edits by hitting `shift+enter`\n4.  Select this cell again (double left click) and now modify the text\n    using markdown syntax in such a way that it becomes a level 1\n    heading (see above).\n5.  Now is a good time ti hist the disk icon in your edit window. This will create a checkpoint. Checkpoints can be used to return to a previous version. As you experiment with code, it is good idea to create checkpoints frequently (typically whenever something works, and before you try a new experiment).\n\nIf you already have a new cell below the heading, change it to\nmarkdown mode (see above), or insert a new cell \n(`Insert -> Cell below`) and change it to markdown afterward.\n\nIn this cell, add the following text\n\n    Course Title:\n    Assignment Title: \n    \n    Date: \n    \n    First Name:\n    \n    Last Name:\n    \n    Student ID:\n\nAdd the current date, first and last name, student id, etc., in the respective places\nafter the colon. Now change the formatting so that the text\nbefore the colon is set in bold, whereas your personal info uses \na regular font. Course title as 1<sup>st</sup>  level heading, Assignment Name as 2<sup>nd</sup> level heading.\n\nThis should look like this\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200921_111320.png \"Formatting example for your notebook submission\")\n\nNow is a good time to save your notebook! Since all\nsubsequent assignments will follow the same format, you can save\na lot of typing by creating a copy of your notebook. Simply\ncall it `notebook-template.ipynb`. So for the next assignment, you can\nsimply copy the template.\n\nNext, go back to your notebook, and add the following elements\n\n-   a new text cell that contains a numbered list of your three most favored foods\n-   a new text cell that contains a bullet list of your three most favored foods\n-   a new text cell that contains #1 below  as a first-level\n    heading, #2 below as a second-level heading, the date as third level heading, and your\n    name as a fourth-level heading.\n    1.

Please submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf\nexport can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So\nyou need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss\nany sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code and the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
