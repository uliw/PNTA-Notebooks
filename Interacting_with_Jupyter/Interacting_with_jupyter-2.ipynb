Text areas (often referred to as cells). You can edit these text-cells.\n2.  Code blocks (or code cells). These contain computer code which can\n    be executed. You can edit and execute these cells.\n3.  Result Blocks, which contain the output produced by a code\n    block. Results blocks cannot be edited. However, you can select and\n    copy them.\n\n![img](./Tianshi/TL-fig-003.png \"An example of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) including text areas, code blocks and result blocks. After double left click on the cell, the cell will be ready for editing (and the bar will change to green)\")\n\nIf you are still reading this as pdf, please switch to the notebook\nversion of this very text. Go to your jupyter home directory, and then\ngo to `PNTA-Notebooks`, `Lectures_and_assignments`,\n`Interacting_with_Jupyter`, and select\n`Interacting_with_Jupyter-2.ipynb` which should you bring right back\nto this text. Now, you can follow the instructions below:\n\nIf you do a single left click with your mouse on this text, you will\nsee that this cell is now drawn with a black border and a blue marker\non the left. This indicates that the cell has been selected (see Fig.[nbselected](nbselected))\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_133749.png \"A single click will select a notebook cell, which is indicated by the blue border to left.\")\n\nIf you double left click on this cell, you will see that the cell\nbackground changes to gray, and the text will be rendered in a\ntypewriter font. This indicates that you are now in editing mode. You\ncan leave the editing mode any time by hitting `Shift-Enter`.\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_133820.png \"A double click on any cell, will active the editing mode.

Create  a\nnew notebook in your `My_stuff` folder. You can do this via the drop\ndown list called `New` in the upper right corner, and then select\n`Python 3`, and rename the new file. These steps should now pose no\nproblem to you. If they do, please speak up!\n\nOnce you new notebook is open, it will look like\nFig. [nbfirst](nbfirst). Notice the text `In [ ]:` on the left side. This\ntells you that this a code cell which expects python code. So before\nwe start playing with text, we need to change the cell type (see Fig. [celltype](celltype))\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_145057.png \"The default view when opening a new notebook. Note the text `In [ ]:` on the left side.

Go back to these\ninstructions, activate editing mode, and explore how to create the\nformatting you see (see Fig.[mdsyntax](mdsyntax)) . Now go to your new\nnotebook, and apply the `mark down` syntax in your own notebook.\n. Remember that you can leave the\nedit mode any time by hitting `Shift+Enter`.\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_153811.png \"Here you can see how to format your text with `mark down` syntax\")\n\nYou may have noted that the list nesting is achieved by merely\nindenting the text after \"This is a simple list\". There are many more\nformatting options, but for this course, we likely won't need them,\nbut feel free to have a look at [this link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n\n**Last but not least** save your edits by clicking on the floppy disk\nicon in the upper left corner.
