A text editor that allows us to write computer code.\n2.  A program that executes our code\n3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n\nThere are many ways to achieve the above, but typically most people use what is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development Environment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDEs available, but most require a local installation. For this course, we will use a web-based IDE, called `Jupyter`, widely used in the sciences and business environments.\n\nIn this unit, you will learn:\n\n1.  How to access a Jupyter server\n2.  How to open a Jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter servers can run locally on your computer, are available commercially for a fee, and some are even available for free (e.g., googles Colab). For this course, we will use a Jupyter server which is provided by Compute Canada and is accessible with your UtorId.\n\nThere are different ways to access your Jupyter account. In this\ncourse, we will use this somewhat lengthy URL:\n[https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/Interacting_with_Jupyter/Interacting_with_jupyter-2.ipynb&branch=main](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/uliw/PNTA-Notebooks&urlpath=lab/tree/PNTA-Notebooks/Interacting_with_Jupyter/Interacting_with_jupyter-2.ipynb&branch=main)\n\nIf you look carefully, you see that the first part specifies the Toronto Jupyter server, which is followed by a redirect to a program called git-pull with reference to a GitHub repository I use for the course materials. This line will first authenticate you, then download or update the course materials, and then start your Jupyter interface.\n\nSo if you click on the above link, it should open a browser window with the link (see Fig. [ref:blink](ref:blink)) (BTW, Sometimes this process fails with an error message. See below how to resolve them.) and this will then take you to your UtorId login screen (Fig. [ref:utorid](ref:utorid))\n\n![img](./Tianshi/TL-fig-002.png \"The UTorID login screen\")\n\nand finally you should see a screen like the one shown in\nFig. [ref:fig-one>](ref:fig-one>)(but without the `My_Stuff` directory).\n\n![img](./figures/screen1.png \"The home screen of your Jupyter session. Note that yours might look slightly different.\")\n\nFor now, don't click on anything, but let's have a look around. If you are unable to see any of the following elements, ask your neighbor, or speak up!\n\nYou can see the Jupyter label in the top right corner, the `Logout` and `Control Panel` buttons in the top right corner. Next comes a line with tabs for `Files`, `Running`, `Clusters`, followed by a line with buttons for `Upload`, `New`, and `Reload`. This is followed by a table.\n\nThe table header starts with a button that lets you select all files or only specific file types. Next comes the blue breadcrumb, which indicates your position in the file system tree. It should read `PNTA-Notebooks`. The next button lets you sort the table by `Name`, the date when the file was `Last Modified`, or the `File Size`.\n\nThe table rows contain a variety of entries, where each entry type is signified by a different icon.\n\n1.  The first one is a folder symbol with no name but two dots. This\n    symbol represents the folder that contains the `PNTA-Notebooks` folder\n    (i.e., one up). If you click on it, you will go to your home\n    folder. You can return to the `PNTA-Notebooks` folder by clicking on the\n    `PNTA-Notebooks` folder symbol.\n2.  Once you are back in the `PNTA-Notebooks` folder, the following file you see is\n    the syllabus. This file shows the notebook icon and also has the\n    `.ipynb` extension, which denotes all Jupyter notebooks. If the\n    notebook is open and active, this icon will be green. Otherwise, it\n    will be gray.\n3.  The next two icons show a paper symbol, which denotes a text\n    file. You can click on these files and read them. If you are done\n    reading, click on the Jupyter icon in the upper left corner\n    to return to the folder view.\n\nLet's make some changes:\n\n1.  Go to your home directory (i.e., one up from PNTA-Notebooks) and in the\n    upper right corner, select `New` and `Folder` see\n    Fig. [ref:nfolder](ref:nfolder)\n\npdf  #+caption: Creating a new folder. Note that we do this from the home directory, i.e., one up from `PNTA-Notebooks`\n  ![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_124326.png)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2df70a9e-7f57-4542-b7b5-37d4cc3f7a7e","metadata":{},"source":["### Jupyter Connection Problems\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b0ccedbc-4c98-4e93-b8c4-73128674430d","metadata":{},"source":["-   If this is the first time you trying to download the course materials\n    -   Sometimes, the process which downloads the course data from the\n        GitHub repository fails.
