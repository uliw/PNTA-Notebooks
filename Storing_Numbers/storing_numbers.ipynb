Transistors are nifty devices which allow us\nto control the flow of a large current with a small current. At their heart,\nthey consist of two layers of thin silicon which has additional electrons\nin the crystal lattice, and thin layer of silicon which is missing some\nelectrons (or vice versa). This thin layer acts as an insulator and\nprevents any current flow (see the sketch below). However, if we add a\nsmall current to this layer, we will move some electrons into the thin\nlayer, which will take the space of the missing electrons in the crystal\nlattice, and now the current can flow between the two outer layers, until\nwe remove the control current again - hence the term semiconductor. See\nthis [youtube link](https://youtu.be/7ukDKVHnac4) for a detailed explanation.\n\n![img](transitor.png)\n\nFor our purposes, a transistor can be thought of as a simple switch, which\neither lets an electrical current pass or not. As such, the transistor can\nreflect the numbers 0 (nothing passes) or 1, everything passes. So with a\nsingle transistor, we can count two numbers (0, 1).  Now, if we add another\ntransistor, we should be able to count to four, however, since each\ntransistor is either on or off, we need to express numbers in a binary\nsystem (i.e., number system, which only knows two numbers like zero and\none).\n\nLet's consider how we count. We have 10 fingers, which we can use to\ncount from 0 to 9. However, what happens if we need to count past 9?\n\n| 100-999|10-99|0-9|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|8|eight|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|9|nine|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|ten|\n| &nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|9|9|ninty nine|\n| 1|0|0|one hundred|\n\nso each time we run out of fingers (counting apples for examples), we\nadd a number to the left, which tells us that we already have ten (or\ntwenty, thirty) apples, which we have to add to the current number of\nfingers. So we are counting in batches of 10. A more scientific way to\nsay this is counting to the base of 10. We can rewrite the above table as\n\n| 10<sup>2</sup>|10<sup>1</sup>|10<sup>0</sup>|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|8|eight|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|9|nine|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|ten|\n| &nbsp;|.|.|.|\n| &nbsp;|9|9|ninty nine|\n| 1|0|0|one hundred|\n\nwhere you would have to multiply the table header with the column\nvalue, e.g., \n\n    10^0 x 8 = 1 x 8 = 8\n\nlets try this with row 7\n\n    9 * 10^1 + 9 * 10^0 = 90 + 9 = 99\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### The binary system\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" So how would we count if we only had one finger?\nZero is easy, (no finger), and so is one (one finger), but what about\n2 and 3 etc&#x2026;\n\nSimilar to the above, we can do a table, but this time to the base of 2\n\n| 2<sup>2</sup>|2<sup>1</sup>|2<sup>0</sup>|Name|\n|---|---|---|---|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|0|zero|\n| &nbsp;|&nbsp;|1|one|\n| &nbsp;|1|0|two|\n| &nbsp;|1|1|three|\n| 1|0|0|four|\n| 1|0|1|five|\n| 1|1|0|six|\n| 1|1|1|seven|\n\nlet's look at the last line in this table, which similar to the decimal system, can be written as \n\n    1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 which is equal to\n    1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 which is equal to\n    4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\nso with three transistor memory cell  we can store\nnumbers from 0 to 7. If we had eight transistors, we could store\nnumbers from zero to 2<sup>8</sup> = 255. Rather than saying a memory cell is eight transistors wide, it is\ncommon to say 8-bit (or 1 byte) wide. \n\nModern computers have memory cells that contain many more cells,\ntypically 64 bits (or 8 byte), which allows them to store numbers from 0\nto 2<sup>64</sup>. \n\nThe above works well for numbers that are positive and have no\nfractional part (i.e., 1, 2, 3 ,4 etc). These numbers are called\nunsigned integers. However, what about storing negative numbers?\n\nIn order to store a negative integer number, we have to sacrifice one\nbit, which will now indicate whether the number is positive or\nnegative. These numbers are called signed integers, and with those, we\ncan count from -2<sup>63</sup> to +2<sup>63</sup>. \n\nNumbers which have a fractional component are called floating-point\n numbers (e.g., 1.2345). In order to store these numbers, we\nneed a way to express them in our binary system. The trick is to\ndecompose them into two integers\n\n    1.2345 = 12345 x 10^{-4} \n\nYou can immediately see that such a number needs double the memory of\nan integer number.\n\nSome computing languages are quite particular about these things, e.g.,\nyou need to declare that a given memory area will only hold signed\ninteger values and any attempt to store another number type will\nresult in an error message.\n\nPython is pretty easy going about this. I.e., if you write `a=1.23`\npython will know that you are storing a floating-point value. So why\ndo we bother with this in the first place? Imagine you are dealing\nwith very small numbers (say environmental pollution in the ppb\nrange), it is important to understand that this number may not be\naccurately reflected in your code. This is in fact one of the more\ncommon problems when you work with computer models.\n\nIt is possible to change the type of a number explicitly, try the\nfollowing example.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out [1]: \n# output\n6.666666666666667\n\n# text/plain\n: 6"}],"source":["a = 20/3  # the result of this division is a floating-point number\nprint(a)  # print the value of a\nint(a)    # convert a into an integer number"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["There are two things to note here: A) the use of\ncomments.
