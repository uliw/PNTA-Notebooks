Nor should you use the `%` operator.   Rather I want you to be creative\nwith loops and string manipulation.

In the above example, your biggest `n` would\nbe 3. \n\nOnce you know your biggest exponent (2<sup>3</sup> in the above example), you need to find the next smaller exponent\n(in the above example 2<sup>1</sup>). You continue this until your exponent `n = 0`.  It is possible to do this with a recursive function, but here you should use a loop instead.\n\nTo achieve this, you may need to use a loop in combination with\na break/continue statement.
