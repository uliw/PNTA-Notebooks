This usually will tell where things go sideways.\n-   If your notebook cell shows an asterisk, it indicates that the code is currently running. Likely a while loop with faulty logic. (Says the wife to her programmer husband: while you are out, can you get some milk? He never returned home &#x2026; ). If this happens, use the kernel menu and select \"Interrupt\". Recheck your logic, maybe add some print statements and restart the kernel.\n-   For your final submission, use the submission template below, and re-work each subsection as necessary.\n-   The idea is to practice functions, loops, if statements and passing arguments back and forth. So you cannot use internal functions or methods.\n-   Last but not least, if you do get stuck, post your questions on the discussion board.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6a72f03f-483f-471f-811e-869b64c6f33e","metadata":{},"source":["### Special Submission instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fbfde45b-adee-4054-9a83-0d8618617c51","metadata":{},"source":["Once everything works, please create a new note book and submit your solution as a single code cell using the below code template.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"406bd6a3-5452-41d3-ad7d-a27e48062d2b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\nDescription:\n\nExample:\nAuthor:\nDate:\n\"\"\"\n# ----------- functions definitions  -----------------------\n\n# ----------- main program ---------------------------------\n# --- variable declarations\nml = [12, 2, 4, 20, 10, 3, 8, 7, 9, 6, 12, 11 ,4]\n\n# --- code starts here\nprint(f\"ml before sorting = {ml}\")\nml = bubble_sort(ml)\nprint(f\"ml after sorting = {ml}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"48bc9af9-1825-4020-ba57-4e9cb3a971e3","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme (22 points)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f49d542c-b3a5-4345-9acf-2b973028bdaf","metadata":{},"source":["-   Code:\n    -   Proper docstrings (functions, and program) 2 points each for a total\n        of 6 points\n    -   Type hinting used for all function signatures  4 points\n    -   Working code: 4 pt for the single pass\n        sorting, 8 points for the bubble sort function .\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b215a2a2-da1f-42fb-97ea-bedb663778a8","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7213dc73-7f64-4c9b-8a9a-2547ff6d1bcb","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it.

This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
