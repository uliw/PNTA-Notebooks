Some are fast, some require memory, and most are pretty complex to be fast without too much memory. Here, we will use a classic algorithm so-called bubble sort algorithm. The approach is elegant but slow. On a side note, the word algorithm represents a sequence of defined instructions/commands. Algorithms have been used since 2500 B.C. (there is a fascinating Wikipedia page on this, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)).\n\nConsider the following list of numbers `[2, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. Rather than numbers, imagine them as little towers with different heights, where the number of stacked X's represents the height of the towers. The characters at the bottom are the respective names of the towers.\n\n             X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A B C D E F\n\nTo sort this list by height, we first compare the first and second element (`A` & `B`). Since `A` is smaller than `B`, no action is required. Next, we compare the second and third elements (`B` and `C`). Since `B` is taller than `C`, it is clearly out of order. We can rectify this by switching the order of `B` & `C` to `C` and `B`\n\n               X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C B D E F\n\nNext, we continue with the third and fourth elements. Clearly, `B` is taller than `D`. So we swap positions again and get\n\n                 X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D B E F\n\nNow for the fourth and fifth elements. Again, `B` is taller than `E`. So we swap both\n\n                   X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E B F\n\nand finally, for the last two elements. Again, `B` is taller than `F`. So we need to do another swap and get\n\n                     X\n             X   X   X\n           X X X X   X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E F B\n    Index: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nAs you can see, this list is not fully sorted yet. All we achieved was that the tallest tower has been moved to the end. The new order is, however, an improvement over the original list. If we repeat this process, we will move the second tallest tower to the right until it is in front of B. We can repeat this process until the list is fully sorted.\n\nSo we have a sequence of instructions (aka algorithm) that moves the largest tower to the rightmost position in the list. Repeated application of these instructions results in a list that is ordered from left to right.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"05654b7c-97ef-4e13-b8c1-0b9243acf263","metadata":{},"source":["### How do I solve this?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5c184634-09c2-449d-ba14-f94ae9a7fb68","metadata":{},"source":["To transform the above into computer code, let's first consider what kind of decisions/actions have to be made to sort the list:\n\n1.  Do I want to panic or not? If yes, take a break and come back in 10 minutes. If no, continue with #2\n\n2.  What kind of list am I dealing with? Rather than using towers, we will use a list with integer numbers that we want to sort in ascending order.\n\n3.  What are the principal actions in the bubble sort method?\n    1.  Compare two elements of a list;\n    2.  Swap two elements of a list.\n\n4.  Do I know how to compare two list elements? If not, go back to the \"Working with lists\" chapter.

Likely, you will need a loop that works through the list, do some comparisons, etc. So, what are the program elements you need?\n\n1.  The list `ml` (see above)\n2.  A for loop and a counter `i` so that you can access each list element and the element to the right of this element (i.e., `ml[i]` and `ml[i+1]`).\n3.  An if statement which decides whether `ml[i] > ml[i+1]` or not.\n4.  A swap statement (see below)\n5.

Rather you want to design your code in small chunks that you can test individually. This can be either done by starting with the overall code structure and then breaking it down into chunks, e.g.,\n\n    While loop that executes until all elements are sorted\n          for loop that does a single-pass bubble sort\n              if swap needed\n                 swap elements\n    \t     \n          decide if we need another pass, \n          or whether we can end the while loop\n\nor by starting with the code fragments, e.g.,\n\n    write code that does the swap\n    test this\n    \n    write code that does a single-pass bubble sort\n    test this\n    \n    embed this code into a while loop\n    test this\n\nWhich approach you choose depends on the programming problem. In this case, the termination of the while loop depends on the result of the for loop that does the bubble sort, which itself depends on the ability to swap numbers. So to me, it seems easier to start with the swapping, followed by the bubble-sort, followed by the while loop.\n\nNext, we must decide whether to write the code bits as functions or combine all code. This is a personal choice, and it will vary with experience. However, your code will be easier to read and test if you break it down into functions. So you could create the following functions:\n\n-   `swap_list_elements()`\n-   `single_pass_bubble_sort()`\n-   `bubble_sort()`\n\nThe last function should return the sorted list. Note that swapping numbers is a one-line statement, so writing a function for this is overkill. Rather, use the swap line inside the `single_pass_bubble_sort()` function.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"03c4bdbd-6eaa-411a-98ef-8c8518318807","metadata":{},"source":["##### Swapping numbers\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ccd376d7-da81-4595-b45f-76e9a9f7fd44","metadata":{},"source":["Here I will provide the code to swap numbers, since it is not obvious that this is the way to go.\nTo swap numbers we can leveraging pythons tuple unpacking.
