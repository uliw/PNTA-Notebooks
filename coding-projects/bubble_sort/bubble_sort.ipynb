Some are fast, some\nrequire plenty of memory, and most are pretty complex in order to be\nfast without consuming too much memory. Here, we will use a slow, but\nsimple algorithm, the so-called bubble sort algorithm. On a side note, the word algorithm stands for a sequence of defined instructions/commands. Algorithms are used at least since 2500 B.C. (there is a fascinating Wikipedia page on this, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).\n\nConsider the following\nlist of numbers =[2, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Rather than numbers, imagine them as little towers with different heights,\nwhere the number of stacked X's represents the height of the\ntowers. The characters at the bottom are the respective names of the\ntowers.\n\n             X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A B C D E F\n\nIn order to sort this list by height, we first compare the first and\nsecond element (`A` & `B`). Since `A` is smaller than `B`, no action\nis required. Next we compare the second and third element (`B` and\n`C`). Since `B` is taller than `C`, it is clearly out of order. We can\nrectify this by switching the order of `B` & `C` to `C` and `B`\n\n               X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C B D E F\n\nNext we continue with the third and fourth element. Clearly, `B` is\ntaller than `D`. So we swap positions again and get\n\n                 X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D B E F\n\nNow for the fourth and fifth element. Again, `B` is taller than\n`E`. So we swap both\n\n                   X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E B F\n\nand finally for the last two elements. Again, `B` is taller than\n`F`. So we need to do another swap, and get\n\n                     X\n             X   X   X\n           X X X X   X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E F B\n    Index: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nAs you can see, this list is not fully sorted yet. All we achieved is\nthat the tallest tower has been moved to the end. The new order is, however, an\nimprovement over the original list. If we repeat this process, we will\nmove the second tallest tower to the right until it is in front\nof B. We can repeat this process until the list is fully sorted.\n\nSo we have a sequence of instructions (aka algorithm) that moves the\nlargest tower to the rightmost position in the list. Repeated\napplication of these instructions results in a list that is ordered\nfrom left to right (if this is unclear to you, please speak up)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### How do I solve this?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To transform the above into computer code, lets first\nconsider what kind of decisions/actions have to be made to\nsort the list:\n\n1.  Do I want to panic or not? If yes, take a break and come back in\n    10 minutes. If no, continue with #2\n\n2.  What kind of list am I dealing with? Rather than using towers, we\n    will use a list with integer numbers that we want to sort in ascending order.\n\n3.  What are the principal actions in the bubble sort method?\n    1.  Compare two elements of a list;\n    \n    2.  Swap two elements of a list.\n\n4.  Do I know how to compare two list elements? If no, go back to the\n    \"Working with lists\" chapter. If yes, can you do this for each list\n    element? If no, go back to the chapter on loops. If yes, continue.\n5.  Do I know how to swap two elements in a list? If no, keep on reading.\n\nMost of the above you have done before, so the key challenge in this\nassignment is to write a function that A) Swaps two elements of a\nlist; B) write code that decides if more sorting is needed, or whether\nwe can stop sorting.

A for loop and a counter `i` so that you can access each list\n    element and the element to the right of this element (i.e., `l[i]`\n    and `l[i+1]`).\n3.  An if statement which decides whether `l[i] > l[i+1]` or not.\n4.  A swap statement (see below)\n5.  From the above, it is also clear, that you may have to repeat the\n    bubble sort until the list is fully sorted.

Rather you want to design your code in small chunks that\nyou can test individually.  This can be either done by starting with\nthe overall code structure and then breaking it down into chunks, e.g.\n\n    While loop that executes until all elements are sorted\n          for loop which does a single pass bubble sort\n              is swap needed\n                 swap elements\n    \t     \n          decide if we need another pass, \n          or whether we can end the while loop\n\nor by starting with the code fragments, e.g.,\n\n    write code that does the swap\n    test this\n    \n    write code that does a single pass bubble sort\n    test this\n    \n    embed this code into a while loop\n    test this\n\nWhich approach you choose depends on the programming problem.  In\nthis case, the termination of the while loop depends on the result of\nthe for loop which does the bubble sort, which itself depends on the\nability to swap numbers.  So to me, it seems easier to start with the\nswapping, followed by the bubble-sort, followed by the while loop.\n\nNext, we need to decide whether we write the code bits as functions\nor whether we mangle all code together. This is a personal choice, and\nit will vary with experience. However, your code will be easier to read\nand much easier to test if you break it down into functions. So you will\nneed to create the following functions:\n\n-   `swap_list_elements()`\n-   `single_pass_bubble_sort()`\n-   `bubble_sort()`\n\nThe last function should return the sorted list.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### Swapping numbers\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Here I will provide the code to swap numbers, since it is not obvious\nthat this is way to go\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a :int = 12\nb :int = 4\nprint(a,b)\nb, a = a, b # swap the values of a and b\nprint(a,b)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To encapsulate this into a function, consider what parameters\nneed to be passed and what kind of return values do you need to pass\nback?
