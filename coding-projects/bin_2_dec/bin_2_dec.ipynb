The challenge with this assignment is that you have to combine several skills, which increases complexity and the likelihood of mistakes. So the key to this exercise is good planning and taking it step by step. Use the table of contents or the index in the textbook to locate previously worked on topics.\n\nI recommend that you take a moment and write down which specific tasks you already know and which you have to find out about. Such a list could look like\n\n    I know:\n         - How to print a string\n         - How to define a function\n         - How to check if a string contains binary number -> see previous assignment\n    \n    I don't know:\n         - How to ask for user input -> see below\n         - How to convert a binary number into a decimal number -> read up in textbook\n\nSo this is the part where you create a plan. Review the chapter on problem-solving strategies, and add to the above list.\n\nNow revisit your above list of things you know and don't know, and create a work plan:\n\n1.  Create a plan (best is to start with a notebook section called \"Plan\" and then make a list for each point):\n2.  Restate the problem\n3.  Divide the problem. Write down each step, even if you don't know yet how to implement a given step. This is a more formal recasting of the above list that is now ordered in the way the program executes.\n4.  If you know the step, precede it with a \"K:\"; if you don't know, precede it with a \"U:\"\n5.  Do not write code all at once. Write code for each sub-step, and test the code individually before you move on. I.e., you can test the part where you ask a user to input a number or stop the program without knowing how to convert the input. You can test the part where you convert a binary number into a decimal number without knowing how to do the input problem (use a function!)\n    1.  If the above snippets work as expected, start combining them.\n6.  Last but not least, don't get frustrated. These exercises are meant for you to struggle, but if after 10 minutes you are still lost on a specific point, post your problem on Piazza. Asking and explaining to others what is not working forces you to restate the problem, and often leads to progress.\n7.  If you post on Piazza, don't just dump all your code. Write a short example that demonstrates your problem. Use proper code fencing, and test that your code runs in Piazza. This will increase the likelihood and quality of the responses.\n8.  Revisit your code, and make sure you have all the required doc-strings and type hints.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5e24e164-fe69-415d-b5d7-1eda70dae629","metadata":{},"source":["### Recap of essential techniques\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2f8972c0-6859-46e9-8988-a815eb44bfb5","metadata":{},"source":["#### Getting user input\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e464fb5b-cbd0-4df9-832a-e1143c9abdb7","metadata":{},"source":["Run the following code and see what happens\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"863398cd-169b-46df-82f1-8d5a684bfe07","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["val = input(\"Enter your value: \")\nprint(val)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"37438661-83fb-4893-8494-7c57a886084a","metadata":{},"source":["#### Python Doc Strings\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4028df70-f7ff-4f3c-8695-334230d440a5","metadata":{},"source":["You already encountered the hashtag sign , which signifies a comment in the code (i.e., everything after the hashtag is ignored). Python provides a second mechanism to add comments into the code, the so-called \"doc-strings\". Unlike regular comments, doc-strings will be used by the `help()` command , and they can span multiple lines. From now on, each of your programs (and functions!) should start with a doc-string, which contains a short text about what the program does, and how to use it, and who authored it. Unlike doc strings in functions, your program documentation starts on top of your code.

This makes for fast coding, but when reading code written by other people, it is often difficult to understand what the code is doing. Python provides so-called type hints to help with this situation. Typically, this is overkill for a short script, but the minute you start working on larger projects or in a team, it greatly helps clarity.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"9b580aa4-a70c-4753-95e0-e36f4c7758b8","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# this valid python code\na = 12\nl = [1, 4, 6]\nt = (4, 9, 1)\ns = \"\"\n# But this is better\na :int   = 12\nl :list  = [1, 4, 6]\nt :tuple = (4, 9, 1)\ns :str   = \"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29eeca10-8307-48c9-aef7-88a3f4e4624f","metadata":{},"source":["Note that python ignores the type hints, so this will not prevent you from doing something like this:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"a2912d9e-9f00-4a07-8f6c-3bafe6776f44","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a :int   = 12\na = \"ssdsd\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"135abcf1-940b-428a-869c-5f05c59e2b03","metadata":{},"source":["but your code will become more readable.
