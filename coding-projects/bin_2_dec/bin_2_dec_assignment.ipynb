The challenge with this assignment is that you\nhave to combine several skills, which increases complexity and the\nlikelihood of mistakes. So the key to this exercise is good planning\nand taking it step by step. Use the table of contents or the index in\nthe textbook to locate previously worked on topics.\n\nI recommend that you take a moment and write down which specific tasks\nyou already know and which you have to find out about. Such a list could look like\n\n    I know:\n         - How to print a string\n         - How to define a function\n         - How to check if a string contains binary number -> see previous assignment\n    \n    I don't know:\n         - How to ask for user input -> see below\n         - How to convert a binary number into a decimal number -> read up in textbook\n\nSo this is the part where you create a plan.

Python provides\na second mechanism to add comments into the code, the so-called\n\"doc-strings\". Unlike regular comments, doc-strings will be used by\nthe `help()` command , and they can span multiple lines. From now on,\neach of your programs (and functions!) should start with a\ndoc-string, which contains a short text about what the program does,\nand how to use it, and who authored it.

That is,\nthe type of variable (int, float, string) is determined at the time\nyou assign it to a value. This makes for fast coding, but when reading\ncode written by other people, it is often difficult to understand\nwhat the code is doing.

Write down each substep, even if you don't\n    know yet how to implement a given step. This is a more formal\n    recasting of the above list that is now ordered in the way the \n    program executes.\n\n4.  If you know the step, precede it with a \"K:\"; if you don't know, precede it with a \"U:\"\n\n5.  Do not write code all at once. Write code for each sub-step,\n    and test the code individually before you move on. I.e., you can test the part where you ask a user to input a number or stop the program without knowing how to convert the input. You can test the part where you convert a binary number into a decimal number without knowing how to do the input problem (use a function!)\n\n6.  If the above snippets work as expected, start combining them.\n\n7.  Last but not least, don't get frustrated. These exercises are\n    meant for you to struggle, but if after 10 minutes you are still\n    lost on a specific point, post your problem on Piazza. Asking and\n    explaining to others what is not working forces you to restate\n    the problem, and often leads to progress.\n\n8.  If you post on Piazza, don't just dump all your code. Write a short\n    example that demonstrates your problem. Use proper code fencing,\n    and test that your code runs in Piazza.
