Continue to prompt the user to enter a positive binary number, until the user stops the program by entering \"s\".

Your program will detect if the user enters data that does not\n    constitute a positive binary number\n\nYour code should not use the built-in python conversion function `bin()` (or `int()`). Instead, use loops, pointers, and if statements to write your conversion function `my_bin2dec()`.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bfc34cca-f035-45c0-925d-4bbbb50cc291","metadata":{},"source":["### Learning outcomes\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cfd90c93-c59c-47a9-8337-2d43f82543dd","metadata":{},"source":["-   practice problem analysis, i.e., break down a problem into smaller problems, identify which parts of the problem you already know solutions for, and which you do not.\n-   practice the application of loops, counters, if-statements\n-   practice the use and creation of functions\n-   learn how to capture user input\n-   learn how to manage complexity\n-   practice testing code fragments\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"817d2da3-6174-428c-aa31-4c7922cf3a7f","metadata":{},"source":["### Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54faa08d-fbb1-470f-b355-0778e371cd2d","metadata":{},"source":["Interaction with your program should look like this:\n\n    Please enter a positive binary number, or stop this program with 's'\n    \n    0010\n    \n    Converting '0010' into decimal notation yields 2\n    \n    Please enter a positive binary number, or stop this program with 's'\n    \n    123\n    \n    '123' is not a binary number\n    \n    Please enter a positive binary number, or stop this program with 's'\n    \n    s\n    \n    Good bye\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bff89221-7fae-4da3-a072-c02a5320a735","metadata":{},"source":["### Test cases\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"47682874-994a-41be-aa4b-03f84da4350a","metadata":{},"source":["Once you have a working code, test that it works.

Otherwise, your edits may be overwritten the\nnext time you log into syzygy. Please name your copy `A#-assignment-name-firstname-lastname` \n\n-   Where `A#` is something like A1, A2 A3, etc.\n-   Replace the `assignment-name` with the name of the assignment\n    (i.e., the filename of the respective Jupyter Notebook). This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
