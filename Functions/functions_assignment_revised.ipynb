Your function will take a dictionary as argument, and return a string that can be printed by the print function. Specifically:\n\n-   if the dictionary value is a number, print the number according to the country settings (use the `:n` format specifier)\n-   If the dictionary value is neither a list, string or number, throw an error\n-   If the dictionary value is dictionary, format this dictionary according to the above rules.\n\nGiven the dictionary `d` and a function `fd()` the following code\n\n    d dict[str, any] = {\n        \"Brian\": 0,\n        \"Bob\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],\n        \"Sam\": {\"Exams\": 75, \"Quizzes\": 90},\n        \"Liam\": [1.000012, 20000, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 78]],\n    }\n    print(fd(d))\n\nshould result in output that looks like this:\n\n    Brian:\t0\n    Bob:\t[1, 2, 3, ..., 8]\n    Sam:\tExams:\t 75\n            Quizzes: 90\n    \n    Liam:\t[1, 20,000, [1, 2, 3, ... 78]\n\nThis requires a couple of steps that are best mapped to individual functions that you can test before assembling everything together So what kind of functions do we? Starting from the top:\n\n-   we need function that formats a dictionary in such a way that the return value can be printed by the print function. Let's call this function `fd()`. `fd()` will take any dictionary as input, and return a formatted string\n-   `fd()` will loop over `d` and hand off each dictionary value to a function `fv()` that knows what to do with those values.\n    -   for strings and numbers, this is easy, but lists require a bit more work. So we will hand this off to a function `fl()` that formats a list in such a way that it only prints the first three elements and the last element of a list (see above).\n    -   `fl()` takes a list as argument, and returns a formatted string.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Let's start simple\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To simplify the above task,  we will only deal with dictionary values that are lists, numbers and strings.
