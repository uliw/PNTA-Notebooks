The technical term is the so called \"variable scope\". Variables that are defined inside a function, have only a local scope. Variables that are defined outside of a function, are known everywhere, but you are not allowed to change their value inside of a function.\n\nWhy would that be useful? Well it allows you to isolate code blocks from each other. That is a big deal, you just don't know it yet. So stay tuned.\n\nIf you are on the ball, you probably wonder, if I can not modify a variable, what useful is a function in the first place? The missing piece, is that we are able to pass values in, and out of a function. To do so, we need to follow a formal process, where we declare the values we want to pass. This is done with the so called function arguments in the function signature. The following code declares that the function `add_numbers` expects two values (`a` and `b`), and will return one value (`c`).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def add_numbers(a, b):\n    c = a + b\n    return c"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This code declares 3 variables that are only known inside the function.

In other words, functions allow us to reduce complexity by breaking the code into isolated code fragments that can be tested individually. \n\nFunctions have the following characteristics:\n\n-   They allow us to group code sequences and refer to this group by name. This is useful to declutter your code, reduce complexity, and allows us to reuse code. \n    Most of the python statements we have used so far are\n    functions (e.g., the print statement).\n-   functions allow us to extend the capabilities of our program. We\n    could, e.g., create a function called `bprint` which will\n    only print in bold.\n-   Functions allow us to isolate code sections from each other. What happens inside the function stays inside the function, and what happens outside the function stays outside. \n    -   This helps with program design because we can\n        divide a program into functional parts that can be tested individually.
