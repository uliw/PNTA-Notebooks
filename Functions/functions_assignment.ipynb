This is useful to declutter your code.\n-   Code inside of a function does not have access to variables that are defined outside of the function.\n    This helps to \n    isolate code sections and to prevent naming conflicts or accidental\n    overwriting of, e.g., a counter.\n-   The **value(s)** of a variable(s) can be passed into a function as\n    arguments to the function call (see below)\n-   The result of a computation inside the function can be\n    returned to the calling code with the return statement.\n-   Functions must always be defined before you can use them. This is\n    best done at the beginning of the code\n\nWhen solving this assignment, be strategic about it. You can probably\nsee that there are three independent challenges here:\n\n1.

In other words,\nthey have the same number of protons but a different number of\nneutrons. You will likely have heard of oxygen or carbon isotopes,\nboth featuring prominently in the current climate change debate and\nisotopes featuring prominently in almost all geoscience research. \n\nStable isotopes ratios are measured with a mass spectrometer where the oxygen\natoms are ionized, then accelerated, and the beam of accelerated ions\nis then sent through a magnetic field, which will bend this beam. The\nions with additional neutrons are heavier and thus will have a\ndifferent curve radius than the lighter ones (see\nFig. [fig:IRMS](#fig:IRMS)). Therefore we can split the beam into two beams. The two\nbeams will then be collected by Faraday cups, which count the number of\narriving ions (i.e., they register a voltage). Based on these\nvoltages, we can establish the ratio between these isotopes.\n\n![img](./Mass-Spectrometer-Schematic.png \"Schematic drawing of an isotope mass ratio monitoring mass spectrometer (IRMS).
