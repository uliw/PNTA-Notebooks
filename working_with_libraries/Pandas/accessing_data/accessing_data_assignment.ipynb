However, some tasks have not yet been explained. By now, you\nknow enough python to read online materials and search for solutions\nto a given problem on your own. So this assignment also aims to expand\nyour agency to deal with problems that are not part of the course\nscript.  I recommend referring to the following sources\n\n-   [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pandas-dataframe](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_dataframe.htm)\n-   [https://pandas.pydata.org/indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n-   [howto-read-csv-with-pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-read-csv-file-using-pandas-ab1f5e7e7b58)\n-   [pandas csv export](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-export-pandas-dataframe-to-csv-2038e43d9c03)\n\nNotes:\n\n1.  All questions should be solved with Pandas methods. You may have\n    to look up syntax or options either through the help system or\n    by using the above links.\n2.  You need to copy `Yao_2018.xlsx`, `cars.csv`, and `dec_deg.csv`\n    into your submissions directory\n3.  Add code cells after each question\n\nFor each answer, write self-contained code that imports\nall libraries declare all variables, imports all data etc., rather\nthan writing code that relies on data imported in a previous\ncell. Cut/copy/paste is your friend here.\n\n1.  Write a code block that will import the `inside_peak` sheet from\n    `Yao_2018.xlsx` into a data frame. Use the `tail()` method to display\n    the last seven rows of this data frame. Note, you need to copy the\n    excel-file into your submission directory!\n\n2.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the 8<sup>th</sup> \n    row of the data frame.\n3.  As above, this time use the `iloc()` method to display the last\n    four values in the third data column (not index!) of the data frame.\n\n4.  As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the last\n    four values in the third data column of the data frame.\n\n5.  Use a pandas data frame method to save your data frame as a \"Comma\n    Separated Textfile\" (CSV) into your local working directory. Your\n    Jupyter server can open CSV files, so please go and check if\n    the data frame has been saved correctly.\n\n6.  Import the `cars.csv` into a data frame, using the \"license plate\" column \n    as the index. Add a `print(df.head())` statement to show the success of your code\n\n7.  As above, this time use the `iloc()` method to display the\n    second row of the data frame.\n\n8.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the\n    second data column of the data frame (not the second column of the csv-file!)\n\n9.  As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the\n    second row of the data frame.\n\n10. As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the\n    second data column of the data frame (not the second column of the csv-file!).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Joining data frames\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["11.

I can guarantee that if you feel\n    uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the\n    same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. The best way to export your notebook as pdf\nis to use your browser's print function (`Ctrl-P`) and then select\n`Save as pfd`.  Please submit both files on Quercus. Note that the pdf\nexport can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So\nyou need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss\nany sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code and the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
