However, some tasks have not yet been explained. Particularly\nhow to create a dataframe from a list or a dictionary. By now, you\nknow enough python to read online materials and search for solutions\nto a given problem on your own. So this assignment also aims to expand\nyour agency to deal with problems that are not part of the course\nscript.  I recommend referring to the following sources\n\n-   [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pandas-dataframe](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_dataframe.htm)\n-   [https://pandas.pydata.org/indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n-   [howto-read-csv-with-pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-read-csv-file-using-pandas-ab1f5e7e7b58)\n-   [pandas csv export](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-export-pandas-dataframe-to-csv-2038e43d9c03)\n\nNotes:\n\n1.  All questions should be solved with pandas methods. You may have\n    to look up syntax or options either through the help system, or\n    by using the above links.\n2.  You need to copy `Yao_2018.xlsx`, `cars.csv`, and `dec_deg.csv`\n    into your submissions directory\n3.  Add code cells after each question\n\nFor each answer, write self-contained code. That is, it imports\nall libraries, declares all variables, imports all data etc., rather\nthan writing code that relies on data imported in a previous\ncell. Cut/copy/paste is your friend here.\n\n1.  Write a code block which will import the `inside_peak` sheet from\n    `Yao_2018.xlsx` into a dataframe. Using the `tail()` method to display\n    the last seven rows of this dataframe. Note, you need to copy the\n    excel-file into your submission directory.\n\n2.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the 8<sup>th</sup> \n    row of the dataframe.\n3.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the last\n    four values in the third data-column (not index!) of the dataframe.\n\n4.  As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the last\n    four values in the third data column of the dataframe.\n\n5.  Use a pandas dataframe method to save your data frame as a \"Comma\n    Separated Textfile\" (CSV) into your local working directory. Your\n    Jupyter server can open CSV files, so please go and check if\n    the dataframe has been saved correctly.\n\n6.  Import the `cars.csv` into a dataframe, using the \"license plate\" column \n    as index. Add a `print(df.head())` statement to show the success of your code\n\n7.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the\n    second row of the dataframe.\n\n8.  As above, but this time use the `iloc()` method to display the\n    second data-column of the dataframe.\n\n9.  As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the\n    second row of the dataframe.\n\n10. As above, but this time use the `loc()` method to display the\n    second data-column of the dataframe.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Joining dataframes\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["11.

I can guarantee that if you feel\n    uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the\n    same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it `ipyn` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. The best way to export your notebook as\npdf, is to select `print`, and then `print to pdf`.  Please submit\nboth files on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file\ncontains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf\nexport is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export\nproblems, please contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code as well as the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
