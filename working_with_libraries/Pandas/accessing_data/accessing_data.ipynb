{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Working with libraries - an introduction\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" Python enables us to\ngroup code via block statements (`if`, `while`, `def` etc.).  However,\nat times you want to refer to a group of code statements. This could\nbe a named python program (as opposed to the code cells we run in a\nnotebook) or a collection of function definitions that provide new\nlanguage elements (aka library or module). The popularity of python\nrests, in fact, on the large number of python libraries that facilitate,\ne.g., seismic inversion, borehole log data analysis, statistics,\ngraphical output etc. etc..\n\nA python library is simply a file that contains function definitions. The key is\nthat this file contains only function definitions and no other\nprogram code. The file must also be written in plain python; it can't\nbe in notebook format. This is no major inconvenience since, most of\nthe time, we only want to use the functions in the file rather than\nchanging the functions. Library development is, however, best done with a full\nfledged python IDE (Integrated Development\nEnvironment). \n\nSo why would we want to use libraries:\n\n1.  Moving often used functions into a library declutters your code.\n2.  Python has myriads of libraries that greatly extend the\n    functionality of the language.\n3.  Another important reason why we prefer to use libraries (rather\n    than writing our own code) is that the developers of the\n    libraries usually spend more time in optimizing the performances\n    and improving the compatibility of the code. Also, if we\n    encounter problems using public libraries, we often can find\n    solutions or helpful information on the Internet. In that sense,\n    by using the libraries, we are collaborating with the\n    whole community.\n\nWhy you would not want to use a library:\n\n1.  Unless it's your own library, you depend on someone else. Imagine\n    this great library you found, but it has this nasty bug, and the\n    guy who wrote this library is no longer responding to\n    e-mail&#x2026;. it might be just easier to implement your desired\n    functionality yourself&#x2026;\n2.  Libraries can introduce considerable complexities, which may be\n    overkill in your situation&#x2026;.\n3.  While python itself is in the public domain, third-party\n    libraries are often under more restrictive licenses. Not a big\n    deal for your private code, but if you work in a commercial\n    environment, it may be a real show stopper.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Using a library in your code\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Consider the following simple library [mylib.py](mylib.py).
