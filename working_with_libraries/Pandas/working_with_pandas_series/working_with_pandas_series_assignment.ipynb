Cut/copy/paste is your friend here. Note,\nyour function should be able to deal with arbitrary length series.\n\n1.  Import the data from `example_file.csv` as a dataframe, and create\n    a pandas-series object for each column. Set all values in `A` that\n    are smaller than 4, to zero.  Note, do not use builtin methods\n    like replace for this operation, nor use a loop (hint: use boolean\n    expressions). Display the dataframe to verify that your operation\n    succeed.\n\n2.  Import the data from `example_file.csv` and write a short\n    function and code snippet which calculates the mean of a pandas\n    series containing numbers. Do not use the builtin functions or the\n    pandas method for mean. Rather use your own code to compute the\n    $\\mu$ mean as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{i=N} X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    the capital sigma sign on the right side is the math symbol for a\n    sum, the subscript `i` refers to the index of a given vector\n    element, $X_i$ denotes an individual element (i.e. `X[i]`) and N is\n    equal to the number of elements in the series. In the equation\n    above I added the index expression to highlight the relation\n    between the equation and a pandas series, however, often you will\n    see the abbreviated form which means the same thing, but is faster\n    to write\n    \n     \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    call your function and compare the result against the mean values\n    as returned by the pandas mean method, e.g.:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["print(f\"The mean value of A using my_mean = {my_mean(A)}\")\nprint(f\"The mean value of A using A.mean() = {A.mean()}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Notes: Your function must not assume a fixed length for the\n    series. Avoid loops where possible and leverage the ability to\n    apply operations to all elements of a data series object.\n\n3.  As before, but now we will compute the population standard\n    deviation sigma ($\\sigma$) which is defined as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}   \n     \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\mu)^2}{N-1}}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    where $\\mu$ is the mean value. Note, since your code regenerates\n    the dataframe from random numbers each time, you need to compute\n    $\\mu$ each time. Thus, this code also needs to define `my_mean()`\n    (you can obviously cut/copy/paste).  Again, your code should be\n    self contained, and compare your result against the builtin\n    pandas series method `A.std`.  Notes: Your function must not\n    assume a fixed length for the data series. Avoid loops where\n    possible and leverage the ability to apply operations to all\n    elements of a data series object.\n\n4.  Import the\n    isotope data  from `Yao_2018_pd_series.xlsx`.  Extract the delta\n    values as pandas series. Next, use the following two equations to\n    first split the delta values (`d34S` in the spreadsheet) into $^{32}S$\n    and $^{34}S$ and append the results to the dataframe as two new\n    columns (`S32` and `S34`). Next compute the delta values from $^{32}S$\n    and $^{34}S$,\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{32}S = \\frac{1000}{(\\delta +1000) \\times R + 1000}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{34}S = \\frac{(\\delta + 1000) \\times R}{(\\delta + 1000) \\times R + 1000}    \t\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\delta^{34}S = \\left(\n      \\frac{\n        \\left(\\frac{^{34}S}{^{32}S}\\right) _{Sample}}\n      {R}\n       -1\n      \\right) \\times 1000 \\quad [^0/_{00}]\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    and append the results to the dataframe as a new column called\n    `delta-new`. Compute the difference between the original and the\n    new delta (it should be very small or zero). Export the data\n    frame to a csv file.  Again, do not use loops and import whatever\n    you need, declare all variables, add docstrings to your function\n    definitions, use comments, and type hinting. Use an R-value of\n    `R=0.044162589`. Remember to break down any coding task into a\n    set of smaller steps that you can develop and test individually.\n    \n      Use the following template to organize your code.
