A pandas\nseries, on the other hand, can only have one data-type per column. In\nother words, a column can contain either strings, integers, floats\netc., but all entries in a given column must be of the same\ntype. Since column `A` consists only of numbers, python can directly\nmultiply each element with 2. What happens if you multiply `A*B`? Is the\nmultiplication element by element, or do you get the cross product?\nWhat happens if you write `A**B`?  Hurray! no more loops!  (kinda&#x2026;)\n\nIn a way, python treats a pandas series object like a vector, not\nunlike matlab. There is some cool stuff we can do with\nthis. We can e.g., apply a comparison operator to a pandas series\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["print(A>2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now, why would this be useful?
