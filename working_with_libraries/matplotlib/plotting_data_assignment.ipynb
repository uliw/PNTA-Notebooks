In the example below, I leverage the NumPy library to create 1-D arrays of numbers. These arrays are list-like objects that resemble pandas Series. However, unlike `pd.Series`, these arrays do not include metadata like an index. Pay attention to the type hinting used for the NumPy array object. We will cover this topic in detail during the NumPy module, but for now, please adhere to this example.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"c9d64ae9-dcd6-43fc-bb62-18b0fae83342","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\nimport numpy.typing as npt  # import numpy type hints\n\n# declare the type hint for a float array\nNDArrayFloat = npt.NDArray[np.float64]\n\n# generate a NumPy array filled with values from\n# zero to 2*pi with a step size of 0.1\nx_1: NDArrayFloat = np.arange(0, np.pi * 2, 0.1)\ny_1: NDArrayFloat = np.sin(x_1)  # calculate the sin(x)\ny_2: NDArrayFloat = np.cos(x_1)  # calculate the cos(x)\ny_3: NDArrayFloat = np.cos(x_1) ** 2 + 2  # calculate the cos(x)^2 + 2\ny_4: NDArrayFloat = y_3 + +y_2 + y_1  # calcualte the sum y1 to y3"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7fd5b93b-c87b-497c-bc44-2bd770ab44ab","metadata":{},"source":["#### Tasks:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c608f414-64b3-4238-959f-be9699cec9ae","metadata":{},"source":["1.  Create a line plot with `x_1` and `y_1` using `matplotlib.pyplot` to annotate the x and y axes with `X` and `Y`\n    1.  As in 1, but this time add a legend that shows $y = \\sin(x)$ for $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$. The legend should show the appropriate math symbols. To make it look pretty, you may have to adjust the y-axis scaling to create enough space for the legend.\n    2.  As in 2, but this time add `y_4` as the second dataset with the same y-scale. The legend for `y_4` should show the correct equation for `y_4` (i.e., not `y_1+Y_2+y_3`!). You plot should show legends for both datasets\n    3.  As in 3, but this time add the second dataset to its own plot. Arrange the plots in an array with one column and two rows, with an image size of 5 by 8 inches. Rather than using a legend, add a title to each subplot with the legend text (e.g., $y = \\sin(x)$ for $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$). Also, add a title for the figure (not the plot!). Hint, explore the use of the subtitle method.\n    4.  As in #2, now show that data as a line plot and overlay the actual x/y data points as a scatterplot (i.e., you only plot the points, but not the connecting lines).\n    5.  As in #5, but this time the color of the line should be different from the scatter marker, and the width of the line should be 4 pixels. Take care that the scatter markers are placed on top of the line.

If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
