The file `sed_rate_vs_sulfate_reduction_rate.csv` contains\n    measurements of the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in\n    marine sediments and the sedimentation rates in the\n    respective sample locations (Claypool, 2004). The sulfate\n    reduction rate is given as a rate constant 1/Mysr, and the\n    sedimentation rate is given in m/Myrs.  Create a scatter plot\n    with the sedimentation rate as X-axis, and the sulfate reduction rate\n    constant as the Y-axis.  The plot axis must show labels with\n    units. All units must be given in square brackets.\n2.  Do a histogram plot to test whether the data is normal distributed\n3.  Data from natural processes often show a log-normal distribution.\n     In other words,\n    once we transform the data into logarithmic space, it will show a\n    normal distribution. Assuming you have a data frame with two\n    series objects called `A` & `B`, you can create the log-transform\n    as a new column like this\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n\ndf['A_log10'] = np.log10(df['A'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Note, this is just a template. You need to adapt it to your own variable names!\n\n4.  Calculate Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient,\n    and state whether the data correlates weakly, correlates, or\n    correlates strongly. Note, you do this analysis on the data you\n    will use for the regression analysis.\n5.  Replot your histogram to test if the log transformed data for\n    sedimentation rate and sulfate reduction rate are now more like a bell curve.\n6.  If you have not already done so, use the template at the end of\n    the module to create a code snippet that will allow you to do a\n    regression analysis on arbitrary X-Y data\n7.  Use this code to perform a regression analysis of the\n    `sed_rate_vs_sulfate_reduction_rate.csv` data-set where the\n    sedimentation rate is the independent variable and the sulfate\n    reduction rate constant is the dependent variable. Your plot\n    should contain the regression model parameters, including the r<sup>2</sup>\n    and p-value. It should also show the confidence intervals for the\n    model and the model predictions.\n8.  Discuss the statistical relevance of your analysis. E.g., is the\n    data normal distributed? How much of the variance is explained by\n    your model? What is the likelihood that your hypothesis is\n    correct? Were there any warnings in the fitting step?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Marking Scheme: 1 pt per question.
