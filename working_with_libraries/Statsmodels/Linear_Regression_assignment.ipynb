The file `sed_rate_vs_sufate_reduction_rate.csv` contains\n    measurements of the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria in\n    marine sediments, and of the sedimentation rates in the\n    respective sample locations (Claypool, 2004). The sulfate\n    reduction rate is given as a rate constant 1/Mysr, and the\n    sedimentation rate is given in m/Myrs.  Create a scatter plot\n    with the sedimentation rate as X-axis, and sulfate reduction rate\n    constant as the Y-axis.  Plot axis must show labels with\n    units. All units must be given in square brackets.\n2.  Calculate Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, and\n    state whether the data correlates weakly, correlates, or\n    correlates strongly\n3.  Use a histogram to test whether both variables show a normal distribution.\n4.  Data from natural processes often show a log-normal distribution\n    (Here we use the logarithm to the base of 10). In other words,\n    once we transform the data into logarithmic space, it will show a\n    normal distribution. Assuming you have a data frame with two\n    series objects called `A` & `B`, you can create the log-transform\n    as a new column like this\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n\ndf['A_log10'] = np.log10(df['A'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Note, this is just a template. You need to adapt it to your own variable names!\n\n5.  Create a new plot using the log10 transformed data for\n    sedimentation rate and sulfate reduction rate.\n6.  Perform a regression analysis of this data-set where the\n    sedimentation rate is the independent variable and the sulfate\n    reduction rate constant is the dependent variable.\n7.  Extract the regression parameters, and use the results to create\n    a single multi line f-string which shows the regression\n    parameters as seen in the previous chapter. Use the `text()`\n    method of the plot handle to place this string in the upper left\n    corner of the plot.\n8.  Using the predict method of your model result object to generate a new set\n    of predicted y-values which you then plot as a regression line on\n    top of your scatterplot.\n9.  Discuss the statistical relevance of your analysis. E.g., is the\n    data normal distributed? How much of the variance is explained by\n    your model, what is the likelihood that your hypothesis is\n    correct? Where there any warnings in the fitting step?\n10. Using the code below, create a dataset with a known linear\n    relationship, then add some noise to it, and then analyze the\n    noisy data and compare it to the actual data. Plot the results of\n    this experiment similar to #6. Plot the original data (i.e.,\n    without the noise) as a blue line, the data with the noise as a\n    scatter plot, and the results of your regression analysis as an\n    orange line.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# here we use the nump library.

The best way to export your notebook as\npdf, is to select `print`, and then `print to pdf`.  Please submit\nboth files on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file\ncontains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf\nexport is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export\nproblems, please contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
