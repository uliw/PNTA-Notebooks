The resulting values are expressed in the same units as the measurements themselves. To calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), one first determines the element-wise difference between the measured value $y_i$ and the true value $\\hat{y}_i$, squares that difference, sums all squared differences, normalizes this sum by the number of data points, and finally takes the square root of the result.\n$$\n\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n$$\nWhere:\n\n-   $ n $ is the number of observations,\n-   $ y_i $ is the actual value,\n-   $ \\hat{y}_i $ is the true value.\n\nIn this section, we will compute the root mean square error (RMSE) using real-life data. As part of my research with the International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), I occasionally participate in expeditions aboard the JR Joides Resolution.\n![img](Joides.jpg)\n\nThe vessel accommodates approximately 24 scientists, 24 technicians, 23 drillers, and around 22 crew members. Expeditions generally last for two months. Although the scientists have specific research goals related to the cruise, their primary responsibilities during the expedition involve conducting routine measurements of core materials. This encompasses gathering geomagnetic, sedimentological, chemical, biological, mineralogical, and structural data.\nI participated in the project twice, contributing to the team's efforts to document the inorganic chemistry of interstitial water (IW), which is the water trapped between sediment grains. This interstitial water is analyzed for various ionic species, including ammonium (NH₄⁺). Ammonium levels are determined using a photometer that quantifies the amount of light transmitted through a sample container at a specific wavelength.\n\nThe photo spectrometer readings are highly precise; however, obtaining accurate concentration values necessitates manual calibration. The initial step involves mixing standard solutions, followed by measuring these standards to establish a calibration function. This calibration function serves to correlate light absorbance with the NH₄⁺ concentration in the standards. Essentially, we develop a linear model to predict NH₄ concentrations based on the absorbance values obtained from the photo spectrometer. The entire process is somewhat of an art form. During my first expedition, I was inexperienced and did not practice adequately, which likely led to carelessness in preparing my calibration standards. Unfortunately, my lab journal does not contain sufficient detail to explain the poor outcomes, but I did obtain the following results (concentration units: μmol/l):\n\n\n| Absorbance|NH4  measured|True value|\n|---|---|---|\n| 75|72|88|\n| 150|144|129|\n| 512|336|330|\n| 1000|596|599|\n\nLeverage Numpy's vector abilities to calculate the RMSE (i.e, do not use loops), instead use the following Numpy functions:\n\n-   `np.sum()`: to calculate the sum of an array.\n-   `np.square()`: to calculate the square of the elements of an array.\n-   `np.sqrt()`: to calculate the square root.\n\nIt's quite simple to look this up, but I encourage you to work through it independently. If you encounter difficulties, remember that most vector operations are performed element by element. Start with the difference, verify your results, and then proceed step by step through the formula by adding squaring and other operations.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"d7bd3351-f6c9-494c-a6d6-62e700c9886d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n\n# Measured NH4 [umol/l] values\nmeasured = np.array([72, 144, 336, 596])\n# Actual observed values\nactual = np.array([88.25575363, 129.74724557, 330.01284664, 599.98415416])\n\nrmse = \n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.1f} [mu mol/l]\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dca8099f-e1e5-4a5d-b4b0-73aa4a698da7","metadata":{},"source":["#### Interpolating temperature data (2 points)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"07ba4305-1962-48a6-8a02-c53cd0e1c710","metadata":{},"source":["Utilize NumPy's `interp()` function to compute the temperatures for days number 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
