One notable example is its interpolation function. Linear interpolation is a technique used to estimate values within the range of a set of known data points. This method is particularly useful when dealing with discrete data and needing to derive a smooth or intermediate value between two observed points. Essentially, linear interpolation assumes that the change between these two points is linear, allowing it to be approximated by a straight line.\n\nMathematically, if we have two known points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, and we want to estimate the value of $y$ for an intermediate value $x$, we use the following formula for linear interpolation:\n\n$$\ny = y_1 + \\frac{(x - x_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} \\cdot (y_2 - y_1)\n$$\n\nHere:\n\n-   $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the known $x$-values (data points),\n-   $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the corresponding $y$-values (data points),\n-   $x$ is the value where we want to estimate $y$.\n\nThis formula essentially calculates how far $x$ is between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (the weight or fraction) and applies the same proportion to the $y$-values.
