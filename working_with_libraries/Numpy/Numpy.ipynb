If you have\nused matlab before, you will be right at home, and if not, let's\nexplore numpy right here. Unlike lists, which can contain a sequence\nof numbers, and all sorts of other things, numpy datatypes, can only\ncontain numbers. Furthermore, the numpy types typically carry a\nspecific meaning that enables us to use them to do linear algebra\n(cross product, scalar product, matrix inversion, etc., etc.).\n\nIn the following, we will use this library for its ability to\nmanipulate lists of numbers.   The basic datatype in numpy, is the array. An\narray has one or more dimensions. Another word for 1-dimensional array\nis vector, and for a two-dimensional array is matrix.\n\nSince numpy arrays can have complex multidimensional structures, type hinting can be tricky. We will restrict ourselves to the trivial case to simply indicate that a variable is a numpy array.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from __future__ import annotations\nimport numpy as np\n\nml: list[int] = range(0, 10, 1)  # create a list\nv: np.ndarray = np.array(ml)  # create array from list\nprint(v)\nprint(v[1])\nprint(type(v))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the above example, we first create a list, then we use `np.array()`\nfunction to convert the list into a 1-dimensional array\n(vector).
