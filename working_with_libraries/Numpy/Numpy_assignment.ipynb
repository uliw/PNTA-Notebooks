You observed that with increasing data density, the match\nbetween model and original data became better. So the above confidence\ninterval is the area where you can be 95% sure that your regression\nmodel fits your data. I.e., in your previous assignment, all orange\nlines would fit inside this envelope. In other words, your regression\nanalysis finds the best fit but depending how noisy your data is,\nuncertainty remains whether the best fit is also the true fit. This\nuncertainty is expressed by the shaded confidence interval.\n\nNote that this is different from the uncertainty of a prediction you\nbase on your regression model. This so-called prediction interval is\nmuch larger. But back to our original problem. We want to create some\ncode that allows us to plot this confidence interval. There is no\nready-made solution, but with a bit of numpy magic, we can create our\nown!\n\nThe shaded area in the above figure, is a polygon. If you were to draw\nthis by hand, you would first draw the outline, and then fill it with\ncolor. The following figure illustrates this approach:\n\n![img](polygon_n.png \"A polygon is drawn by following it's outline either clockwise or anticlockwise\")\n\nThe key here, is that we have to draw in a consistent direction,\neither clockwise, or anticlockwise (you remember those drawing by\nnumbers books?).

First create your regular regression graph (6 by 4 inches, ggplot\n    style, proper axis labels with units, no title, no legend,\n    but include the regression parameters similar to\n    Fig. [storksandbabies](#storksandbabies), and the regression line\n2.  The polygon method is not part of matplotlibs pyplot interface, so\n    you need to import it separately (see the code snippet below)\n3.  The polygon is made transparent with the alpha parameter (from 0 to\n    1). You still need to pay attention to what is plotted first and last\n4.  Adding a polygon to a plot does not update the plot axis limits.
