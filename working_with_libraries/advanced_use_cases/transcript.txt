ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)> I am teaching a python class for a non-technical audience. Each year, I struggle with the chapter on functions. The problem is that the students are only exposed to short programs, so they are unable to see the importance of a function in a larger project. Can you think of a python example that ist not to complex, yet demonstrates the advantages of using a function instead of unstructured code?
<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>
Certainly! A great way to demonstrate the importance of functions in a larger project is to take a repetitive task within a simple program and show how functions can encapsulate that logic, reduce redundancy, and make the code more readable.

Here’s an example that revolves around a relatable scenario: processing user input and performing a set of operations repeatedly. The program calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, including tax. First, I’ll show the unstructured (repeated code) version, followed by the improved version using functions.

---

### **Unstructured Code (Without Functions)**

```python
# Hardcoded program without functions

# Item 1
item1_price = float(input("Enter price of item 1: "))
item1_quantity = int(input("Enter quantity of item 1: "))
item1_total = item1_price * item1_quantity
item1_total_with_tax = item1_total * 1.08  # Adding 8% tax
print(f"Total for item 1 with tax: ${item1_total_with_tax:.2f}")

# Item 2
item2_price = float(input("Enter price of item 2: "))
item2_quantity = int(input("Enter quantity of item 2: "))
item2_total = item2_price * item2_quantity
item2_total_with_tax = item2_total * 1.08  # Adding 8% tax
print(f"Total for item 2 with tax: ${item2_total_with_tax:.2f}")

# Grand total
grand_total = item1_total_with_tax + item2_total_with_tax
print(f"Final total for all items (with tax): ${grand_total:.2f}")
```

**Why it's problematic:**
1. Repeating similar logic for each item.
2. Difficult to add more items without copying and pasting similar blocks of code, which leads to redundancy.
3. Hard to debug or modify (e.g., updating the tax rate would require multiple updates across the entire program).

### **Improved Code (With Functions)**

Now, let’s use functions to encapsulate the repetitive logic:

```python
# Improved program using functions

# Function to calculate total price of an item with tax
def calculate_total_with_tax(price, quantity, tax_rate=0.08):
    total = price * quantity
    total_with_tax = total * (1 + tax_rate)
    return total_with_tax

# Main program logic
def main():
    grand_total = 0
    
    for i in range(1, 3):  # Loop for 2 items
        print(f"Item {i}:")
        price = float(input("Enter price of item: "))
        quantity = int(input("Enter quantity of item: "))
        
        # Use function to calculate the total with tax
        item_total_with_tax = calculate_total_with_tax(price, quantity)
        print(f"Total for item {i} with tax: ${item_total_with_tax:.2f}")
        
        grand_total += item_total_with_tax
    
    print(f"Final total for all items (with tax): ${grand_total:.2f}")

# Run the program
main()
```

**Advantages of Using Functions:**
1. **Reusability:** The `calculate_total_with_tax` function can be reused for any number of items, removing the need for repetitive code.
2. **Maintainability:** The logic is centralized. If you need to update the tax rate, you only update it in one place (the function’s default parameter).
3. **Readability:** The main program logic is shorter, clearer, and more focused on the flow of the program rather than the details of individual calculations.
4. **Scalability:** Adding more items or changing the input process (e.g., reading from a file instead of user input) would be much easier.

---

### Suggested Teaching Approach:

1. **Show the unstructured code** and ask students to identify repetitions or problems if the program needs scaling (e.g., 10 items instead of 2).
2. **Introduce the concept of a function** and explain how it encapsulates code logic to make it reusable.
3. **Show the improved version with functions,** pointing out its clarity and flexibility.
4. Gradually have students brainstorm where else functions could be used in their own examples.
