As in 2, but this time add `y_4` as second dataset. The legend for\n        `y_4` should show the correct equation for `y_4` (i.e., not `y_1+Y_2+y_3`!).\n    3.  As in 3, but this time add the second dataset to its own\n        plot. Arrange the plots in an array with one column and two rows,\n        with an image size of 5 by 8 inches. Rather then using a legend,\n        add a title to each subplot with the legend text (e.g., $y =\n             \\sin(x)$ for $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$). Also, add a title for the figure\n        (not the plot!). Hint, explore the use of the subtitle method.\n    4.

As in #5, but this time the color of the line should be different\n        from the scatter marker, and the width of the line should be 4\n        pixels.

The best way to export your notebook as\npdf, is to select `print`, and then `print to pdf`.  Please submit\nboth files on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file\ncontains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf\nexport is complete and does not miss any sections.

Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand.
