Below I use the NumPy library to generate 1-D arrays of numbers. These arrays are list-type objects similar to the pandas Series object. Unlike the `pd.Series` they do not carry any meta-data like an index etc. \nNote how I use type hinting for the NumPy array object. We will discuss this in detail in the NumPy module, for now, just follow this example\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n\n# generate a NumPy array filled with values from\n# zero to 2*pi with a step size of 0.1\nx_1: np.ndarray = np.arange(0, math.pi * 2, 0.1)\ny_1: np.ndarray = np.sin(x_1)  # calculate the sin(x)\ny_2: np.ndarray = np.cos(x_1)  # calculate the cos(x)\ny_3: np.ndarray = np.cos(x_1)** 2 + 2 # calculate the cos(x*2)+2\ny_4: np.ndarray = y_3 + +y_2 + y_1  # calcualte the sum y1 to y3"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Tasks:\n\n1.  Create a line plot with `x_1` and `y_1` using matplotlib annotate the x and y axes with `X` and `Y`\n2.  As in 1, but this time add a legend that shows $y = \\sin(x)$ for\n    $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$. The legend should show the appropriate math\n    symbols. To make it look pretty, you may have to adjust the\n    y-axis scaling to create enough space for the legend.\n3.  As in 2, but this time add `y_4` as the second dataset. The legend for\n    `y_4` should show the correct equation for `y_4` (i.e., not `y_1+Y_2+y_3`!).\n4.  As in 3, but this time add the second dataset to its own\n    plot. Arrange the plots in an array with one column and two rows,\n    with an image size of 5 by 8 inches. Rather than using a legend,\n    add a title to each subplot with the legend text (e.g., $y =\n         \\sin(x)$ for $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$). Also, add a title for the figure\n    (not the plot!). Hint, explore the use of the subtitle method.\n5.  As in #2, now show that data as a line plot and overlay the\n    actual x/y data points as a scatterplot.\n6.  As in #5, but this time the color of the line should be different\n    from the scatter marker, and the width of the line should be 4\n    pixels. Take care that the scatter markers are placed on top of\n    the line.
