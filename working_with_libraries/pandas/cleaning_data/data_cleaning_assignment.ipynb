In a second step modify the `categorize_time` function in such a way that it returns `day_1`, `day_2` etc (and similar for the nights). For this, you need to loop over all `date_time` entries and then use a counter that only increments when your measurement's reach a new day (or night). Start by implementing the solution from the previous task as a loop. Once this works start modifying the function.\n3.

So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
