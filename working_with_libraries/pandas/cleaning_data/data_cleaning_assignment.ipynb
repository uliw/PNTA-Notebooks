In a second step modify the `categorize_time` function in such a way that it returns `day_1`, `day_2` etc (and similar for the nights). For this, you need to loop over all `date_time` entries and then use a counter that only increments when your measurement's reach a new day (or night). Start by implementing the solution from the previous task as a loop. Once this works start modifying the function.\n3.  Calculate and print the average day and night time temperatures using the pandas `group_by` functions.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"a478fc1e-2657-447c-a7af-97c03dacc439","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"51cfdf91-47e2-4ef6-abb4-7a4ff878bb02","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"28b2fc60-002f-4ce9-a312-df2fb9c64982","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it.

This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, or external data, you must also copy the image and data files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
