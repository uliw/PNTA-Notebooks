However, some tasks have not yet been explained. By now, you know enough Python to read online materials and search for solutions to a given problem on your own. So this assignment also aims to expand your agency to deal with problems that are not part of the course script. I recommend referring to the following sources:\n\n-   [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pandas-dataframe](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_dataframe.htm)\n-   [https://pandas.pydata.org/indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n-   [howto-read-csv-with-pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-read-csv-file-using-pandas-ab1f5e7e7b58)\n-   [pandas csv export](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-export-pandas-dataframe-to-csv-2038e43d9c03)\n\n**Notes**:\n\n1.  All questions should be solved with pandas methods. You may have to look up syntax or options either through the help system or by using the above links.\n\n1.  You need to copy `Yao_2018.xlsx`, `cars.csv`, and `dec_deg.csv` into your submissions directory\n2.  Add code cells after each question\n\nFor each answer, write self-contained code that imports all libraries declares all variables, imports all data etc., rather than writing code that relies on data imported in a previous cell. Cut/copy/paste is your friend here.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"68bae34b-12cd-4d92-aefc-33a201f83ebb","metadata":{},"source":["### Tasks\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b1d4a383-2dd5-4f11-9047-cd0a763efff1","metadata":{},"source":["1.

Otherwise, your edits may be overwritten the\nnext time you log into syzygy.

This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
