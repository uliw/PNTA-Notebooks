However, at times you want to refer to a group of code blocks. This could be a named Python program (as opposed to the code cells we run in a notebook) or a collection of function definitions that provide new language elements (aka library or module). The popularity of Python rests, in fact, on the large number of Python libraries that facilitate, e.g., seismic inversion, borehole log data analysis, statistics, graphical output etc. etc&#x2026;\n\nA Python library is simply a file that contains function definitions. The key is that this file contains only function definitions and no other program code. The file must also be written in plain Python; it can't be in notebook format. This is no major inconvenience since, most of the time, we only want to use the functions in the file rather than change the functions. Library development is, however, best done with a full-fledged Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment). \n\nSo why would we want to use libraries?\n\n1.  Moving often-used functions into a library declutters your code.\n2.  Python has myriads of libraries that greatly extend the functionality of the language.\n3.  Another important reason why we prefer to use libraries (rather than writing our own code) is that the developers of the libraries usually spend more time optimizing the performances and improving the compatibility of the code. Also, if we encounter problems using public libraries, we often can find solutions or helpful information on the Internet. In that sense, by using the libraries, we are collaborating with the whole community.\n\nWhy you would not want to use a library:\n\n1.  Unless it's your own library, you depend on someone else. Imagine this great library you found, but it has this nasty bug and the person who wrote this library is no longer responding to e-mail&#x2026;. it might be just easier to implement your desired functionality yourself&#x2026;\n2.  Libraries can introduce considerable complexities, which may be overkill in your situation&#x2026;\n3.  While Python itself is in the public domain, third-party libraries are often under more restrictive licenses. Not a big deal for your private code, but if you work in a commercial environment, it may be a real show-stopper.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1ad7f41f-e184-4926-8402-dad510076b96","metadata":{},"source":["### Using a library in your code\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"545beade-7051-4b6e-9c2b-3f327b6efce9","metadata":{},"source":["Consider the following simple library [mylib.py](mylib.py).
