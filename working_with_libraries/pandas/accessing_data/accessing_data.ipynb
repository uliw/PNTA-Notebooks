It also provides an easy way to read data from files that contain comma-separated values (CSV), or from Excel spreadsheets, HDF files, etc., etc. Here we will use isotope data from a recent paper by one of my graduate students (Yao et al. 2018)\n\nIn the following code snippet, we import the Pandas library with the alias `pd`. So all of the functions provided by pandas are available as `pd.function_name()`. We will explore how to use some of the Pandas provided functions below. Since pandas is a system library, you do not need a local copy in each working directory.\n\nTo read the excel file we need to know its name, and we need to know the name of the data sheet we want to read. If the read operation succeeds, the data will be stored as a pandas data frame object. You can think of the Pandas data frame as a table with rows, columns, headers, etc.. Pay attention to the way I use type hinting to indicate that `os_peak` is a variable that contains a data frame.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"a65d10dd-e103-4425-b651-25459d8ffbf7","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd # inport pandas as pd\n\n# define the file and sheet name we want to read.

If this does not make sense to you, please speak up! Otherwise, try both methods here: Note that I here use the `display()` function, rather than the print function. `display()` will attempt to render pandas table-like data as a table.

At first sight, it appears that we mix `iloc()` and `loc()` syntax here. However, this is not the case. Rather, this command treats the **index** column as a label.
