The file `sed_rate_vs_sulfate_reduction_rate.csv` contains measurements of the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine sediments and the sedimentation rates in the respective sample locations (Claypool, 2004). The sulfate reduction rate is given as a rate constant 1/Myrs, and the sedimentation rate is given in m/Myrs.  Create a scatter plot with the sedimentation rate as X-axis, and the sulfate reduction rate constant as the Y-axis.  The plot axis must show labels with units. All units must be given in square brackets.\n2.  Regression analysis is only valid if your data shows a [Gaussian Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). To get a quick  idea of how your data is distributed, we can use a [histogram plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) test whether the data is normal distributed. Data from natural processes often show a log-normal distribution.  In other words, once we transform the data into logarithmic space, it will show a normal distribution. Assuming you have a data frame with two series objects called `A` & `B`, you can create the log-transform as a new column like this\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"13d5aeb3-b379-41e6-a94d-bb6af255c7e7","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df['A_log'] = np.log(df['A'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"65dabdc3-95da-4350-9e34-41b0866adf46","metadata":{},"source":["Note, that this is just a template. You need to adapt it to your own variable names! Also, note that most natural data show a log-normal rather than a log10-normal distribution. Plot two histograms (for the X and Y data) and then test if a log-transform improves the data distribution.\n\n3.  Use a [qqplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot) to test whether your original or log-transformed data is normal distributed (test both).\n4.  Use a Shapiro-Wilk test to check if your original or log-transformed data is normal distributed (test both).\n    5.  Going forward we will use the data that best fits the normal distribution. Using this data calculate the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, and state whether the data correlates weakly, correlates, or correlates strongly.\n    6.  Perform a regression analysis of the `sed_rate_vs_sulfate_reduction_rate.csv` data-set where the sedimentation rate is the independent variable and the sulfate reduction rate constant is the dependent variable. Your plot should contain the regression model parameters, including the r<sup>2</sup> and p-value. It should also show the confidence intervals for the model and the model predictions. Note: **Never do a regression analysis on data that is not normal distributed!**\n    7.  Discuss the statistical relevance of your analysis. E.g., is the data normal distributed? How much of the variance is explained by your model? What is the likelihood that your hypothesis is correct? Were there any warnings in the fitting step?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"96d811fe-8bcd-4b8f-b40a-5c8774943491","metadata":{},"source":["### Part B\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b72fcbda-b4aa-415a-86b1-6f47a8d55bbe","metadata":{},"source":["Here we return to the Ammonia measurements from my ODP cruise.

This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, or external data, you must also copy the image and data files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat.

In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e231f76f-58a6-41fb-b25c-7fe56edc4317","metadata":{},"source":["### References\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6c3d2a3a-d155-496c-8307-1ff8a957aff2","metadata":{},"source":["-   E.
