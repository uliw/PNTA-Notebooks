Storks were indeed a common sight in rural areas, and large enough to sell this story to a 3-year-old.\n\n![img](Ringedwhitestork.jpg \"The Stork. Image by Soloneying, Wikimedia Downloaded Nov 22, 2019.\")\n\nAs mature scientists who value critical thinking, we seek data to support this idea. Specifically, we expect to find a strong correlation between the number of storks and the number of babies born. Surprisingly, these two variables do indeed correlate in a statistically significant manner. Countries with larger stork populations tend to have higher birthrates. This phenomenon, where both variables increase together, is referred to as a positive correlation.. See Fig. [4](#orge713715)\n\n![img](stork-new.png \"The birthrate and the number of stork pairs correlate in a statistically significant way. This analysis suggests that each stork pair delivers about 29 human babies, and that about 225 thousand babies were born otherwise. Data after Matthews 2000.\")\n\nThis does not prove that storks deliver babies. Clearly, the correlation between two observable quantities does not imply causation. A more plausible explanation is that both variables are influenced by a shared factor, such as industrialization. It is a common mistake to confuse correlation with causation. Another good example is to correlate drinking with heart attacks. This surely will correlate, but the story is more complex. Are there, e.g., patterns like drinkers tend to do less exercise than non-drinkers? So even if you have a good hypothesis why two variables are correlated, the correlation itself proves nothing.\n\n \nRegardless of a causal relationship, the correlation between two datasets can be quantified using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC, commonly referred to as r). This coefficient indicates both the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. The PPMCC ranges from +1 (indicating a perfect positive correlation) to -1 (indicating a perfect negative or inverse correlation). Correlations are considered weak when they fall between +0.3 and -0.3, and strong when they exceed +0.7 or are lower than -0.7. It is important to note that correlation analysis does not assume any specific functional form between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variable (x). This means that the PPMCC does not provide information on whether the correlation is linear, logarithmic, exponential, or of any other form.\nWe can use the `corr()` method of the pandas series object to calculate the PPMCC:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"7126996a-307a-4320-91d9-8cd1631c1a41","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd  # inport pandas as pd\nimport pathlib as pl\n\nfn: str = \"storks_vs_birth_rate.csv\"  # file name\ncwd: pl.Path = pl.Path.cwd()\nfqfn: pl.Path = pl.Path(f\"{cwd}/{fn}\")\n\nif not fqfn.exists():\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Cannot find file {fqfn}\")\n\ndf: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_csv(fn)  # read data\ndf.columns = [\"Babies\", \"Storks\"]  # replace column names \nb: pd.Series = df[\"Babies\"]\ns: pd.Series = df[\"Storks\"]\n\nprint(f\" r = {s.corr(b):.2f}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5eaebd02-67e8-4e46-ae5e-1d6ac03f1a17","metadata":{},"source":["Based on this analysis, we can confirm that the number of babies and storks correlate.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"af3b9303-05fb-4db2-ae05-441509a24deb","metadata":{},"source":["### Understanding the results of a linear regression analysis\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4cf3c7d4-aba3-4d23-a43c-b186ead2a3c2","metadata":{},"source":["Linear regression analysis builds upon correlation analysis by evaluating how effectively a linear function, such as a straight line, represents the relationship between two variables, x and y. A straight line is described by the equation `y = mx + b`, where adjustments are made to the coefficients m (slope) and b (y-intercept) to minimize the difference between the observed data points and the predictions made by the model. Numerous libraries are available to facilitate this fitting process, and ideally, they provide not only the resulting linear model (the equation of the fitted line) but also additional parameters that assess the quality of the fit.\n\nThe most common parameter is the coefficient of determination, denoted as r<sup>2</sup>. This metric indicates how effectively a linear relationship can explain the correlation between the dependent variable `y` and a single independent variable `x`. In the figure above, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.38, suggesting that 38% of the variation in the number of new-born babies can be accounted for by a linear correlation with the number of storks. Often, however, multiple independent variables are needed to better capture the variability in the data. In such cases, Multiple Linear Regression is utilized, represented as `y = x1 + x2 + x3… + xn + b`. This approach involves simultaneously solving a system of linear equations (a concept from Linear Algebra) and provides the Multiple Coefficient of Determination, denoted as R<sup>2</sup>, which quantifies the proportion of variability in `y` explained by the combination of independent variables x<sub>i</sub>. Many programs default to using R<sup>2</sup> even with a single independent variable, which can be misleading since capital R<sup>2</sup> should be reserved for analyses that involve multiple independent variables.\n\nFrom a user perspective, we are interested to understand how good the model is, and how to interpret the key indicators of a given regression model:\n\n-   **r<sup>2</sup>:** or the coefficient of determination. This value is in the range from zero to one and expresses how much of the observed variance in the data is explained by the regression model. So a value of r<sup>2</sup>=0.7 indicates that 70% of the variance is explained by the model, and that 30% of the variance is explained by other processes which are not captured by the linear model (e.g., measurements errors, or some non-linear effect affecting `x` and `y`). In Fig. [BROKEN LINK: fig:storks] 38% of the variance in the birthrate can be explained by the increase in stork pairs.\n-   **p:** In linear regression, we hypothesize that `y` depends on `x` and that they are connected by a linear equation. When testing a hypothesis, it is essential to also evaluate the **null hypothesis**, which in this context asserts that `y` is unrelated to `x`. The p-value indicates the probability that the null hypothesis is true. For instance, a p-value of 0.1 suggests a 10% chance that there is no correlation in your data, while a p-value of 0.01 indicates a 1% chance of no correlation. Generally, we can reject the null hypothesis if `p < 0.05`, implying that we are 95% confident the null hypothesis is incorrect. In Fig. [BROKEN LINK: fig:storks], we achieve a confidence level of 99.2% in deeming the null hypothesis false. It is important to note that the relationship between r² and p is not always straightforward.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2c48c6b0-1c6f-4079-8335-92d2dc990d9c","metadata":{},"source":["### Testing the data\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"221f795f-bd25-4eae-83a4-488e34e19e2c","metadata":{},"source":["#### Histograms\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bc9cd871-d128-41cd-a4d5-cb3967f64e83","metadata":{},"source":["\nThe Storks data set is interesting; however, it does not meet a crucial requirement for linear regression analysis: the data must exhibit a [Gaussian Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (or bell curve). \nTo quickly assess the distribution of your data, you can create a [histogram plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) to determine whether the x and y values are normally distributed.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"28c6e8fc-2eaf-4a92-9be3-4a859b785f65","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd  # import pandas as pd\nimport pathlib as pl\n\nfn: str = \"storks_vs_birth_rate.csv\"  # file name\ncwd: pl.Path = pl.Path.cwd()\nfqfn: pl.Path = pl.Path(f\"{cwd}/{fn}\")\nif not fqfn.exists():  # check if the file is actually there\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Cannot find file {fqfn}\")\n\ndf: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_csv(fn)  # read data\ndf.columns = [\"Babies\", \"Storks\"]  # replace colum names\n# display(df.head())  # test that all went well\n\nfig, [ax1, ax2] = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1)  #\nax1.hist(\n    df.iloc[:, 0],\n)\nax2.hist(df.iloc[:, 1])\nax1.set_title(\"Babies\")\nax2.set_title(\"Storks\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig(\"strk_histogram.png\")\nplt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2cb7d921-ae99-48b0-9d64-f35f7984d539","metadata":{},"source":["![img](strk_histogram.png)\nAs shown in the histogram, our data clearly does not follow a normal distribution.

In this section, we will utilize the \"statsmodels\" library, though many other statistical libraries are also available. The statsmodels library offers several interfaces, and we will focus on the formula interface, which resembles R's formula syntax (for more details, see [https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html)). However, it's important to note that not all functions in statsmodels are accessible through this interface at this time.\n\nFor the regression model, we aim to investigate whether the number of storks correlates with the number of babies born. In other words, does the birth rate depend on the stork population? To do this, we must define a statistical model and evaluate how well its predictions align with the data. **It is important to note that as of March 2025, the statsmodels library does not support type hinting.** \n\nTo enhance clarity, we will replace the specific data-dependent names in the lengthy code with more general aliases. For the independent data (\"Storks\"), we will use `X`, and for the dependent data (\"Babies\"), we will use `Y`. I  use the `df.columns()` method (line 12) to set the column names to `\"X\"` and `\"Y`. This approach allows us to avoid having to change variable names in multiple locations if we repeat this process in the future. After importing the data, we proceed to create a statistical model on line 16 of the code below. Note how the model is specified using the formula `\"Y\" ~ \"X\"` indicating that the number of Babies (`Y`)is dependent on the number of Storks (`X`). It is essential that these names match the variable names in the data frame `df`. Once the model is defined, we call the `fit()` method to fit the model using the data (line 17). The results of this method will be stored in the `results` variable. Line 18 subsequently invokes the `summary()` method on the results object.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"d47eb410-520f-4f18-9e27-3a9952a7191d","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"/home/uliw/miniforge3/envs/py311/lib/python3.13/site-packages/scipy/stats/_axis_nan_policy.py:430: UserWarning: `kurtosistest` p-value may be inaccurate with fewer than 20 observations; only n=17 observations were given.\n  return hypotest_fun_in(*args, **kwds)\n| Dep.

See the code below for an actual example.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"399729dc-f100-4f3e-aae0-3f56d1276740","metadata":{},"source":["### Creating the Stork Figure\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"859a6ef5-93ee-4e45-88aa-eb3f840489bd","metadata":{},"source":["Now let's put it all together.
