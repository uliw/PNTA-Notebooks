However, unlike ifs and loops, functions allow us the create named code blocks. This allows us to reduce complexity, and to write modular code (what does this even mean?). Consider the `print()` statement. This is a function that comes as pre-packed with a python. It is however just a named code block that handles output. Imagine you would have to write 10 lines of code each time you wanted to print a string. \n\nOr to make another example. Imagine you write code for an ATM. Your code will ask the user to input his bank card number. Now we have make to make sure that we strip all spaces, test that the input contains only numbers, than we calculate the checksum to see if the number is valid, and then we query the database to see if there is a corresponding bank account, and then we can ask for the pin. You can do all of that without writing any functions, but you probably end up with 100 lines of code. Trying to find an error in this code will be messy to the say the least. If you use functions, your code would instead look like this:\n\n    input = strip_blanks(input)\n    calc_checksum(input)\n    if not calc_checksum(input):\n        break \n    \n    \n    if get_account_info(input) > 0:\n       password = ask_for_password()\n    else:\n       break \n\nUnlike 100 lines of code, the above is easy to read and it is obvious what you are trying to do. So this is already helpful. However, the true power of this approach is that it allows you to test each function independently. So you first make sure that `strip_blanks()` works. Next you test `calc_checksum()`, and so forth. When all of these modules work, you just string them together as in the above example. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a1c25142-72e3-42ca-8ac2-fca4d35ae4a6","metadata":{},"source":["### Some Examples\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0dea2c06-b030-4bb1-a2bd-20e26857665d","metadata":{},"source":["The following code defines a function with the name `foo()` . \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"19627a9e-278a-448a-85a2-eb59c2d750b6","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def foo():\n    a = 12\n    print(a)\n\nprint(foo())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d7ab93ec-1589-410e-a9d1-21f8198b7273","metadata":{},"source":["As with other code blocks, we use indentation and colon here.
