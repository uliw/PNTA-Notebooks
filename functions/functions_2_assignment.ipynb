This is useful for decluttering your code.\n-   Code inside a function does not have access to variables defined outside of the function. This helps to isolate code sections and prevent naming conflicts or accidental overwriting of, e.g., a counter.\n-   The **value(s)** of a variable(s) can be passed into a function as arguments to the function call (see below)\n-   The result of computation inside the function can be returned to the calling code with the return statement.\n-   Functions must always be defined before you can use them. This is best done at the beginning of the code\n-   The end of a function block should always be followed by two empty lines!\n-   Think about your data types and add the appropriate type hints.\n-   When everything works, write the doc-string.\n-   Test your docstring with the help function.\n\nIn the following, we will create a small collection of formatting functions.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a69a0454-b6f0-4835-aed5-472507785351","metadata":{},"source":["### Formatting a list 3 points\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ee8b87fc-5f75-4780-ba52-ef90da7a020c","metadata":{},"source":["Create a function that takes a list as an argument and returns a string that shows up to 3 list elements, and the last list element, e.g.:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"d932283a-cca6-4c80-a01b-8491d06e6a6e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["[1,2] # will result in \"[1, 2]\"\n[1,2,3] # ->  \"[1, 2, 3]\"\n[1,2,3,4] # ->  \"[1, 2, 3, 4]\"\n[1,2,3,4,5] # ->  \"[1, 2, 3, ..., 5]\"\n[1,2,3,4,5,6] # ->  \"[1, 2, 3, ..., 6]\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c056da0b-87c9-449a-9ef3-cb2ab3243dcd","metadata":{},"source":["Use the following template to create this function\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"4b1c4721-562c-4bd6-a3ee-b50ed0824112","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def format_list(ml: list[Any]) -> str:\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    return s"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c1099483-7750-4bb6-8d59-4aceacdd43c1","metadata":{},"source":["Test your code with the following\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"011d517a-75b5-4d9e-a0dd-9e8395bcafe7","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a :list[Any] = [\n    [],\n    [1],\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [1, 2, 3, 4],\n    list(range(20)),\n    \"Hello\",\n    [\"Hello\", \"World\"],\n]\n\nfor e in a:\n    print(format_list(a))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b98cfb5b-44b6-4ee3-baac-2a3e9bdcb22a","metadata":{},"source":["### Format a variable value depending on its type 3 x 3 = 9 points\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9ec6cddb-a13b-423a-80c2-3504f5058efb","metadata":{},"source":["This function takes a variable value and returns a string that is formatted similarly to the following examples\n\n    s = \"Hello World, what a sunny day\" -> \"Hello World what a ...\"\n    i = 123400 -> 123,400 (use commas to separate 1,000 and 1,000,000\n    f = 0.00000001 -> 1E-9\n\nNote the use of quotation marks for string values!\n\nI'll provide a function signature and a few code fragments to show you how to use the `isinstance()` function o test the type of a given object, as well as some code that raises an error.

Otherwise, your edits may be overwritten the\nnext time you log into syzygy. Please name your copy `A#-assignment-name-firstname-lastname` \n\n-   Where `A#` is something like A1, A2 A3, etc.\n-   Replace the `assignment-name` with the name of the assignment\n    (i.e., the filename of the respective Jupyter Notebook). This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
