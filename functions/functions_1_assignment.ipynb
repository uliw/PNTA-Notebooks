This is because the  `enumerate()` function returns a so-called generator object, rather than a list, but this is for another day. For this exercise, we want to write our own enumerate function (let's call it `my_enum()` that will simply return a list of tuples where each tuple has the following structure: `(index, value)` \n\nAs usual, it is much faster to develop new code incrementally, so let's approach this in the following way\n\n1.  Write a function that takes a list as an argument, and returns the list to the calling code. 1pt\n2.  Modify your function in such a way that it uses a loop to copy each list element into a new list, and return that list to the calling function. 1pt\n3.  Modify your function again, so that instead of copying each list element,  it will create a tuple for each list element, where the first element of the tuple equals the list index, and the second element equals the value at the given index. Note, create an empty tuple named `my_result` before you enter into the loop, and then append each tuple to `my_result`. Return `my_result` the calling function. Note, that you are not allowed to use the `enumerate()` function! 1pt\n4.  Add a doc-string that describes what your function does. 1pt\n5.  Test your code by running the following cell. The output of the print statements should be identical. 2pt\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"698f4f4b-d8fa-4bdb-99d0-e7b3e78e9a2f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["ml = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nprint(my_enum(ml))\nprint(list(enumerate(ml)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6b440e2a-8203-4552-b5db-4cc536be4657","metadata":{},"source":["#### Building your own items() function 6 points\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bdb18704-bc97-460c-8e4a-0c00b926fe02","metadata":{},"source":["The `items()` method of a dictionary returns a list of tuples with the dictionary key, and its value for each dictionary entry.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"675d1179-2308-457a-a7be-4958e60f2a2d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["my_dict = {\n    \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"Phone #\": \"645 934 1212\",\n}\n\nprint(my_dict.items())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4f2318fb-c0fe-4f84-ae07-df07901965ee","metadata":{},"source":["Create a function called `my_items()` that will achieve the same result when you execute the following code:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"c23358ce-048f-4aa7-99b3-ecf4b07331ee","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["my_dict = {\n    \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"Phone #\": \"645 934 1212\",\n}\n\nprint(my_items(my_dict))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9fcc3d95-da2a-45c9-86fc-bde5aa93c8ea","metadata":{},"source":["To traverse the dictionary, use a for loop in the following way\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"fcbb5758-8f49-4747-8390-7421d9281c3e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["for k in my_dict:\n    key = k\n    value = my_dict[k]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9c33aa07-0045-4b8b-ae1f-22913eb366c9","metadata":{},"source":["Test your function in the following way:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"9705d463-be7e-4ea8-a5f5-13d019d58706","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["for key, value in my_items(my_dict):\n    print(f\"key = {key}, value = {value}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"82ded29f-4b35-4815-8da4-5e6a496bb5ae","metadata":{},"source":["5 points for the correct output, 1 pt for the doc-string.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d6eb5e31-bb4e-4d18-8dda-e2aa4142149a","metadata":{},"source":["#### Pretty print a dictionary 6 points\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"92fb4e23-ee5c-412b-80c1-c347ace3b035","metadata":{},"source":["The default printout of a dictionary is not very pretty\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"da1951cd-58bb-459c-9498-c7662721eaca","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["my_dict = {\n    \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"Phone #\": \"645 934 1212\",\n}\nprint(my_dict)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"80a07865-20eb-4469-8151-636e992e9ece","metadata":{},"source":["Write a function that takes a dictionary as an argument, and **returns a formatted string** so that each dictionary key-value pair is printed on a new line.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"aeff50b9-00ae-4cf3-b984-d3510546e89a","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["my_dict = {\n    \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"Phone #\": \"645 934 1212\",\n}\n\nprint(format_dict(my_dict))\n\"\"\" This should result in the following output\nName: John Doe\nPhone #: 645 934 1212\n\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2ac1f4a1-b4ba-47ef-9add-051dd7bb37f6","metadata":{},"source":["Note that `format_dict()` does not print the dictionary, rather it must return a string that then can be printed by the `print()` function.  5 points for the correct output 1 pt  for the docstring.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8c66b95a-45ec-4319-9507-c650cbc1a619","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"621c4075-2955-4b00-9e89-111919e0d02b","metadata":{},"source":["-   As indicated in the individual questions\n\nTotal: 18 points\n\nCreate a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it. Otherwise, your edits may be overwritten the\nnext time you log into syzygy. Please name your copy `A#-assignment-name-firstname-lastname` \n\n-   Where `A#` is something like A1, A2 A3, etc.\n-   Replace the `assignment-name` with the name of the assignment\n    (i.e., the filename of the respective Jupyter Notebook). This can be shortened as long as it remains clear which assignment it is.\n-   `firstname-lastname` with your own name.\n\nNote: If the notebook contains images, you must also copy the image files!\nYour notebook/pdf must start with the following lines :\n\n**ESS245: Assignment Title**\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\nBefore submitting your assignment:\n\n-   Check the marking scheme and ensure you have covered all requirements.\n-   Re-read the learning outcomes and verify that you are comfortable with each concept. If not, please speak up on the discussion board and ask for further clarification. I can guarantee that if you feel uncertain about a concept, at least half the class will be in the same boat. So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it as `ipynb` notebook format **and**\n`pdf` format:\n\n-   **Do not use File -> Save and Export as -> pdf!!!**\n-   You **must** use your **browser's print function** (`Ctrl-P`, or `Cmd-P` on a Mac) and then select `Save as pdf`.  In the past, this worked best with Chrome or Firefox.\n\nPlease submit **both files** on Quercus. Note that the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter python code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or create a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your answers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code executes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions before submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by** hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file\\* should show the code and the results of the code execution.\\*\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
