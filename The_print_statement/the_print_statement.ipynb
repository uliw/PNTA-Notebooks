Here is a\nsummary. If any of these concepts or terms are unclear, please go back\nto the previous modules and discuss them with your TA/Prof where necessary.\n\n1.  While python understands numbers without help, we have to\n    mark strings with quotation marks (otherwise, python would interpret\n    it a variable or function name): `s = \"Hello World\"`\n2.  It matters how we use brackets:\n    -   Square brackets to the right of an equal sign indicate that you\n        declare a list: `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Square brackets to the right\n        of a name or letter indicate an index expression: `a[1] =\n               22`. Index expressions can also be used to address ranges and\n        stepsize: `a[1:2:1]`.\n    -   Round brackets to the right of an equal sign are used to\n        declare a tuple: `t=(1, 2, 3)`, whereas round brackets to the\n        right of a name indicate that this name is a function:\n        `print()`. To access the 2<sup>nd</sup> element of the tuple,\n        you will still have to use square brackets since you are doing\n        an index operation: `t[1]`. Tuples are immutable.\n    -   Curly braces to the right are used to declare a set: `u =\n               {1,2,3}`. Set members cannot be retrieved by an index\n        operation, and set values are immutable.\n    -   Curly braces are also used to declare dictionaries. In this case,\n        the declaration contains key:value pairs that are separated by\n        a colon. `d = {\"B\":12, \"A\":14, \"C\":7}`. Dictionary entries can\n        be retrieved by using an index expression using the dictionary\n        key: `d[\"B\"]`\n3.  A name followed by regular brackets denotes a python function:\n    `print()`. Functions exist independently of data (or objects like lists).\n4.  A name followed by a dot and another name with brackets denotes\n    an object method: `a.sort()` which only exists as long as the\n    object `a` exists.\n    -   Object methods can either modify the object-associated data in\n        place, e.g., `a.sort()`\n    -   Or, they do not modify the object associated data, but instead\n        return something, e.g., `s.split(\",\")`. So if you would like to\n        change the original data set, you would have to write an\n        explicit assignment: `s = s.split(\",\")`. If in doubt, use the\n        `help()` function.\n5.  We can query the object type with the type function: `type(a)`, and\n    we can list the object-associated methods with the dir function:\n    `dir(a)`\n6.  We can get help on python functions with the help command:\n    `help(print)`\n7.  We can get help on object methods with the help function:\n    `help(list.pop)`\n8.  The name of a compound variable (e.g., lists) refers to its\n    object handle, not its value.  Thus, the expression `my_new_list\n         = my_old_list` will not copy the list values; it will only copy\n    the memory address where those values are stored. In other words,\n    if you modify `my_new_list`, you will also modify\n    `my_old_list`. To create an independent copy you need to use the\n    copy method: `my_new_list = my_old_list.copy()`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Using print()\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" By now, you probably\nnoticed that the print statement is a function.
