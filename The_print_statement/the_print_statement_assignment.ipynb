Use an\n     f-string and use the appropriate syntax so that the actual value of\n     `a` is printed.\n\n-   Using the same code as above and include escape sequences in such a\n    way that your printout is preceded and followed by an empty line\n    (1pt).\n\n-   Using the same code as in 2, precede and follow the empty lines\n    with 41 dashes (see below). Note that rather than typing (and\n    counting), use this statement `'-' * 41`. Your result should look like\n    this - including the empty lines.

(1pt)\n\n-   You are working on software for a point of sale system (i.e., cash\n    register). Your software knows the sales price and\n    how much cash you receive from the customer. Write some python\n    code that calculates and displays the change owed. Your display\n    should look like this (your number may be different!):\n    \n        Change owed = $12.40\n    \n    Notes: A) You code should correctly round the owed amount to the\n    nearest 10 cents and display the cents as in the above example; B)\n    You should achieve this by using the appropriate format modifier\n    and by making good use of the f-string. Assume that the customer\n    provided you with a twenty-dollar bill and that the item's price\n    was CAD 6.63. Also, test your code with a price of $6.67. (4pts)\n\n-   Using the example in #6, print a proper receipt rather than\n    printing the change owed. Towards this end, add a variable that\n    describes the item. Your output should look like this (note that\n    the point separating the cents from the dollars must be aligned)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\nCheese        $6.63\nHST           $\n-------------------\nTotal         $\n\nPaid          $\nChange owed = $\n\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Notes: This is meant to be an actual program.

The advantage is that  if\n   you want to change your price or item name, you change the\n   variable definition at the beginning of the code, rather than\n   having to modify the internals of your code.\n\nNotes: \n\n-   you first need to calculate the HST (13%)\n-   Do not forget to do the rounding and make sure that  `total` plus `changed_owed` are equal to `paid`. In other words, be  on the lookout for rounding errors.\n\n-   The dollar sign of the price should be three tab stops to the right. The length of the item description should    be limited so that it won't displace the price. Test  this by setting `item = \"Really Long Pasta\"` (5pts)\n\n-   Avoid long and complex print statements. Rather, use a new print statement for each line. Coding is the art of avoiding complexity.\n\nTotal Points: 14\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission Instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new (or copy and existing) notebook in your `submissions`\nfolder before editing it.

The best way to export your notebook as pdf\nis to use your browser's print function (`Ctrl-P`) and then select\n`Save as pfd`.  Please submit both files on Quercus.

If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer.
