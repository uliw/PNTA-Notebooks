Use an\n     f-string and use the appropriate syntax so that the actual value of\n     a is printed.\n\n2.  Using the same code as above, include linefeed statements in such a\n    way that your printout is preceded and followed by an empty line\n    (1pt).\n\n3.  Using the same code as in 2, precede and follow the empty lines\n    with 41 dashes (see below). Note that rather than typing (and\n    counting) use this statement `'-'*41`. Your result should look like\n    this - including the empty lines.

Using the above code add an escape sequence in front of \"The\n    value&#x2026;\", so that this line is displayed with one tab to the\n    right. (1pt)\n\n6.  You are working on software for a point of sale system (i.e., cash\n    register). Your software knows about the sales price, as well as\n    how much cash you received from the customer. Write some python\n    code which calculates and displays the change owed. Your display\n    should read:\n    \n        Change owed = $12.40\n    \n    Notes: A) You code should correctly round the owed amount to the\n    nearest 10 cents, and display the cents as in the above example; B)\n    You should achieve this by using the appropriate format modifier\n    and by making good use of the f-string. Assume that the customer\n    provided you with a twenty dollar bill, and that the price was CAD\n    6.63. Also, test your code with a price of $6.67. (4pts)\n\n7.  Using the example in #6: Rather than printing the change owed,\n    print a proper receipt. Towards this end, add a variable which\n    describes the item. Your output should look like this (note that\n    the dollar signs should all be aligned)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\nCheese        $6.63\nHST           $\n-------------------\nTotal         $\n\nPaid          $\nChange owed = $\n\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Notes: This is meant to be an actual program.

In other words be\non the lookout for rounding errors. C) The dollar sign of the price should be three\ntab stops to the right.
