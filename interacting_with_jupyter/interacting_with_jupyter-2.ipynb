Text areas (often referred to as cells). You can edit these text cells.\n2.  Code blocks (or code cells). These contain computer code that can\n    be executed.

These steps should now pose no problem to you. If they do, please speak up!\n\nOnce your new notebook is open, it will look like\nFig. [ref:nbfirst](ref:nbfirst). Notice the text `In [ ]:` on the left side. This\ntells you that this is a code cell that expects python code. So before\nwe start playing with text, we need to change the cell type (see Fig. [ref:celltype](ref:celltype))\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_145057.png \"The default view when opening a new notebook.
