Thus it is\nnot easy to answer the questions with more text of your own. However,\nyou can split the existing text. Click the text cell you want to\nsplit, position the cursor to where you want to the split occur, and\npress the following keys at the same time \"shift enter minus\". Leave\nthe edit mode with shift enter, and you can now insert a new text cell\nwith your answer below. Please use this method from now on.\n\n1.  Write a short code snippet that uses the variable `a`.  If a\n    equals 3, your code should print `a equals three`. If a is\n    larger than three your code should print `a is larger than 3`,\n    and if a is smaller than 3, your code should print `a is smaller than 3`. \n     Use three independent if statements to achieve this\n    result. Test and verify your code with `a` being, 2,\n    3, 4. Correct if statements 1pt, correct comparison statements\n    1pt, correct print statements 1pt, 3 tests 1pt. Total 4 pts.\n\n2.  Same as above, but this time use a single if statement with\n    `elif` and `else`.  Test and verify your code with different\n    values for `a`. Correct `elif` & `else` statements: 2pts, correct\n    comparison: 1pt. Total 3 pts\n\n3.  Now modify your code in such a way that the comparison is no\n    longer hard-coded, i.e., use a second variable `b` so that your\n    comparison is done like `a ==` b. Your print statement should\n    reflect the dynamic nature of `b`, i.e., it should now print the\n    value of a and b and their respective relation:\n     `3 equals 3`.\n     Test and verify your code with different values for `a` and\n    `b`. Correct if statements & comparison: 2pts, correct print\n    statements: 1pt. Total 3 pts\n\n4.  If you were to execute this code block, what would be the result? I want you to think it through, not to run it as code!\n    (4 pts):\n    \n        a = 5\n        \n        if (a == 5) :\n           print(f\"a equals five\")\n        if a > 3 :\n           print(f\"a is larger than three\")\n        if a < 5 :\n           print(f\"a is smaller than five\")\n        if a < 10:\n          print(f\"a is smaller than 10\")\n\n5.  How would you need to restructure the above code to only\n    print the result of the first true comparison (but not that it is\n    smaller than 10)? Write your code below and test it with values of\n    `a=3` and `a=9`.  Note, you must keep all comparisons in the code!\n    This time, your answer should be proper python code! (2 pts)\n6.  Write if-statement(s) that result in one of the following two\n    statements depending on the value of `a`. Test your code with\n    various values of `a` (and make sure to include the numbers 3 and\n    7 in your test). Correct statements 2pts, tests 1pt. Total 3 pts.\n    \n        a is inside the range from 3 to 7\n        a is outside the range from 3 to 7\n    \n    Note: When I say range from 3 to 7, then 3 and 7 are part of this range.\n7.  Do the same as in the above, but this time use a combination of boolean\n    and comparison operators to create a single if statement which will\n    create the above output (i.e., you only have one if-block and one\n    else-block). (3 pts)\n8.  Without using boolean operators, write some code that tests\n    whether the value of `a` is in the range between 100 and above 80\n    (i.e., `<` 100=, but `>80`), in the range between 80 but above 60,\n    in the range between 60 and 40.  Your code should print a\n    warning message if `a` is larger than 100 and smaller than 40. Otherwise, your code should print which bucket `a`\n    belongs to (where a bucket is one of the intervals, i.e., 80 to\n    60, etc.). Test your code for various values of `a`. Make sure you\n    test the boundary cases 80, 60, 40, the extreme cases like 110 and\n    20, and intermediate values like 85, 64, and 55. (8 pts)\n9.  As in the above, but this time use boolean operators to combine\n    your comparison operators (8 pts)\n10.

So don't be shy!\n\nTo submit your assignment, you need to download it `ipyn` notebook\nformat **and** `pdf` format. Please submit both files on Quercus. Note\nthat the pdf export can fail if your file contains invalid\nmarkup/python code. So you need to check that the pdf export is\ncomplete and does not miss any sections. If you have export problems,\nplease contact the course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you have to enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your answers will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code as well as the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
