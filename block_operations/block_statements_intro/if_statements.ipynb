    "The previous section taught you the various methods to\n",
    "store, access, manipulate, and display data. The next big step in\n",
    "learning how to code is to combine these methods to\n",
    "create a program that can achieve a purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a program can often be a daunting experience. Often, you\n",

    "pretty quickly. However, similar to hiking, where you may not see the\n",
    "entire way ahead of you, all that is needed is the ability to take\n",
    "the first step, and to have a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this case: You have been asked to write a program that will\n",
    "convert a binary number into a decimal number. We can divide this task into three sub-tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   get user input (the binary number)\n",
    "-   convert the number to decimal\n",
    "-   provide user feedback by printing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write (and test) code for the above steps without\n",
    "knowing anything about the other two. In other words, programming is\n",
    "an exercise of dividing a problem into smaller problems that\n",
    "you can tackle step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages thus provide a variety of methods to group\n",
    "statements. The three basic groups shared by almost all languages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  \"if groups\" that allow you to group programming statements\n",
    "    based on a given condition (e.g., if `A` is larger than 10 do this,\n",
    "    else, do that)\n",
    "2.  \"loop groups\" that allow you to repeat programming statements a\n",
    "    given number of times (or until a condition is met)\n",
    "3.  functions allow you to group code statements as well, but this time\n",
    "    the statements inside the function are invisible to the code\n",
    "    outside the function. A good example is the `print()`\n",
    "    function. You, as a user, do not need to know the code of the print\n",
    "    function, you only need to know how to pass a value to the print\n",
    "    function. This shields you from the complexity of how to actually\n",
    "    print characters on the screen. This keeps your code clean, and\n",
    "    reduces complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three methods of grouping computer code allow you to solve pretty\n",
    "much any computing task.  \n",
    "The last module explored the use of comparison operators that return truth values. To branch the sequence of execution in our code depending on a given circumstance, we will need a statement that takes a truth (boolean) value and allows us to create two groups of code. One gets executed if the statement is true, and another block gets executed when the statement is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages know a variation of the so-called \"if-then-else\" clause. The `if` part expects a truth value and executes the code followed after the `then` in case the value is `True`. In the case of a `False`, it will execute the part after the `else`. This is pretty straightforward, and the only other ingredient needed is a way to group programming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In python, all block statements end with a colon, and the code group** following this block statement has to be indented.\\* You end the code block by returning to the previous indention level. See this example:\n",
