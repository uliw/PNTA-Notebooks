Use your notes/textbook! It also  involves a lot of steps. So it is best to write down each step and find out how to solve each step, before trying to solve the entire task. If you do not know how to do a step, you need to break it down even further. To give and example how you could write down things:\n    1.  Find out how many columns are in `d`\n        1.  Need to read up on how to access keys and values in a dictionary\n        2.  Test key/value access in a simple example dictionary (not the one above!)\n        3.  Test how to count keys with a simple example dictionary\n        4.  Write some code that prints the keys of the example dictionary\n        5.  Write some code that prints the keys of the example dictionary as in the markdown example\n    2.  Return to the dictionary as defined for the assignment. Print column headers\n    3.  etc. etc.\n-   You cannot assume that you know how many rows and columns are in `d`\n-   You can assume that the number of values for each key is the same\n-   Since we want the output rendered as markdown, you cannot use the print statement. Rather, build a single string that contains everything (including the linefeeds!).
