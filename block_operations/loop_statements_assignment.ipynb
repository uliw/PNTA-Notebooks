The best way to export your notebook as pdf\nis to use your browser's print function (`Ctrl-P`) and then select\n`Save as pfd`.  Please submit both files on Quercus. Note that the pdf\nexport can fail if your file contains invalid markup/python code. So\nyou need to check that the pdf export is complete and does not miss\nany sections. If you have export problems, don't hesitate to contact\nthe course instructor directly.\n\nNotebooks typically have empty code cells in which you must enter\npython code. Please use the respective cell below each question, or\ncreate a python cell where necessary. Add text cells to enter your\nanswers where appropriate. Your responses will only count if the code\nexecutes without error. It is thus recommended to run your solutions\nbefore submitting the assignment.\n\n**Note: Unless specifically requested, do not type your answers by**\n**hand. Instead, write code that produces the answer. Your pdf file**\n**should show the code and the results of the code execution.**\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
