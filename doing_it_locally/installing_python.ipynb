However, it is best to install a private python, so that your experiments won't interfere with your operating system. The best-known python distribution is `Conda` but the installation is huge and takes forever. Here we will use [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which only installs a basic system. \n\n1.  Select the installer for your OS, and download the miniforge distribution\n2.  Next we need to use the `mamba` packet manager to install the python packages we need (do not use the `conda` manager, it is really slow!).\n3.  Open a command prompt and type the following:\n\n    mamba install matplotlib numpy pandas statsmodels\n    mamba install scipy pathlib argparse spyder\n\n4.  Some of these may already be installed, and if you get errors that something is missing, you may need to install the missing libraries with mamba\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Runnig Python code from the cmd-line (terminal)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   open a cmd-line (powershell etc), and type python (or python3 if python does not work)\n-   You should see a line stating something like this\n\n    Python 3.11.5 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Aug 27 2023, 03:34:09) [GCC 12.3.0] on linux\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n-   your information may be different, but it should say conda-forge\n-   You can now use this Python shell (it comes in handy as a calculator)\n-   To exit, hit `Ctrl-d`\n-   Next, enter `spyder` this should open the spyder IDE.\n-   Create a simple filed called `hello_World.py` with a suitable print statement.\n-   exit spyder\n-   from within the terminal, check that you can see `hello_World.py` (use the ls or dir command)\n-   if yes, type the following `python -m hello_world`, which should run and execute the print statement. If no, consult  [https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/>](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/>)to explore where things might have gone wrong.\n\nAt this point, you have learned:\n\n-   how to install python\n-   how to install Python libraries\n-   how to use spyder to create/edit Python code\n-   how to start a Python shell from the command line\n-   how to run a Python script from the command line.\n\nThere is a lot more to this, i.e., how to create icons for your Python programs, how to create file associations so that you can open jupyter-notebooks with a right click, but all of this is operating system dependent and sometimes takes a bit of fiddling. Also, spyder may not be the preferred IDE, but all of this is way beyond what we can do today. [https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/>](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/>)is a good starting point for your own explorations \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Writing a shell script\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["When we write a shell script, we need some way to interact with the user of that script, i.e., what happens if the script needs a filename, but none was supplied. Thankfully there is a library for this (note that his code will not work inside a jupyter noteboook, this is strictly for interactive programs)\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n    \"\"\" Name: filename_test.py\n    Author\n    Date\n    Description: This code\n     - imports the argparse library,\n     - creates a parser object\n     - tells the parser object that this program requires a\n       'filename' argument\n    - parse the cmd line parameter(s)\n    - assigns the cmd-line parameter to the variable fn\n    - print the result of this operation\n    \"\"\"\n    import argparse\n    \n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"filename\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    fn: str = args.filename\n    print(f\"fn = {fn}\")\n\nCopy this code into spyder, save it as `filename_test.py`, and use the terminal to test this:\n\n    python -m filename_test\n    python -m filename_test ammonium.csv\n    python -m filename_test ammonium.csv 1 2\n    python -m filename_test -h\n    python -m filename_test --help\n\nNeat! argparse will inform us that the program must be called with a filename! It will also inform us that we provided some unknown parameters! We can even use the `--help` argument (also a `-h`).\n\nFor our linear regression code, we also need to know which data columns to use. We can use the `add_argument()` to add further arguments like this\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        \"-x\",  # short name\n        \"--independent_variable\",  # long name\n        dest=\"x\",  # store as args.x\n        type=int,  # check that it is an integer number\n        required=True,  # this is a required parameter\n        help=\"Column index of the independent variable\",  # help text\n    )\n\nMake sure you use the above **before** you call  `parser.parse_args()`\nSo you program would look like this now:\n\n    import argparse\n    \n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"filename\")\n    parser.add_argument(\"-x\", \"--independent_variable\",\n        dest=\"x\", type=int,required=True,\n        help=\"Column index of the independent variable\"\n    )\n    parser.add_argument(\"-y\", \"--dependent_variable\",\n        dest=\"y\", type=int, required=True,\n        help=\"Column index of the dependent variable\",\n    )\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    \n    fn: str = args.filename\n    x: int = args.x\n    y: int = args.y\n    print(f\"fn = {fn}, x={x}, y={y}\")\n\nTo make the program complete, we need to add some description that explains what this program will do or not do (you may also need to add a few more options, like the the Shapiro-Wilk override). You can add a general program description when you create the parser object:\n\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n                        prog='ProgramName',\n                        description='What the program does',\n                        epilog='Text at the bottom of help')\n\nand optional parser arguments like this\n\n    parser.add_argument(\"-s\", \"--Shapiro-Wilk Test\",\n        dest=\"shapiro\", required=False, default=\"yes\",\n        help=\"Perform normality test using the Shapiro-Wilk test\"\n    )\n\nAdd these elements to your program, and test that everything works as\nexpected. Then what is left to do, is to copy your code from the capstone\nassignment into this command-line script, and test it against the various\ndatasets.  Maybe add some code to automatically set the filename of the figures\nyou are creating, add an option to select pdf or png format, etc. etc.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
