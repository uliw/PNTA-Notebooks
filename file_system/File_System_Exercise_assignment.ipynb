On a Windows computer: Open Explorer and go to `My Computer` ->\n    `Drive C:` (it could also be `This PC -> Windows8_OS (C:)`). You\n    may also need to activate the option \"Show hidden files\"\n2.  On a Mac: Expose the hard disk you are working with by \n    [following\n    these instructions:](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-turn-on-drive-icon-mac-macbook/)\n\nNow you have the tools to create your file system map. Please create\nan image similar to the above. Note that the above image is from my\nlinux computer. This will look very different on a Mac, or a\nPC. However, you will find the following elements irrespective of your\noperating system:\n\n1.  The full path to the directory where your operating system stores\n    the executable for your browser (e.g., `firefox.exe` on windows or\n    `firefox.dmg` (or firefox.app) on a mac (or whatever your browser\n    is called). Please include the name of the executable and it's file\n    extension as well (use an oval to denote files, and square boxes\n    for folders (see the example image). Note that in the above image,\n    the octave program is has no extension (that is a unix thing).\n\n2.  The full path to the directory where your browser stores your\n    downloads. In my case, this would be `/home/uliw/Downloads/` (**test\n    this by downloading a file!**)\n3.  Note, if you don't have software to do a block diagram, you can\n    draw the figure by hand, and take a picture with your cellphone.\n4.  Save your figure in **jpg format** using the following naming\n    convention:\n    \n    `Firstname-Lastname-FS-exercise.jpg`.\n    \n    Note the absence of any blanks, the use of the dash in the file\n    name, and the way the capitalization is used. We will use this type\n    of file name throughout the course.  Note that some programs will\n    save your image file as `filename.jpeg`. Quercus will complain\n    about the `jpeg` extension. Simply rename it to `filename.jpg`, and\n    all is well.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Last but not least\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   review the above learning outcomes\n-   if you do not feel confident about any of these, please review\n    the corresponding textbook chapter.\n-   If this does not help, please post on the discussion board.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   4pts for the correct file system tree\n-   2pts for using the correct image format\n-   3pts for using the correct filename template.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
